<H2><A NAME="obj_intro">INTRODUCTION</A></H2>

In early November 2015 I wrote code into Fusion3D to write the visualization of the DEMs into a file in .obj format.
The motivation was to write data that could be viewed on the Oculus Rift.
<P>
All the hi-res DEMs at initialization of the viewer are written.
The option works only from Project Files and is not implemented in menus.
The location that you wish to write must be specified as the origin in the Project File as well as the number of hi-res tiles.
The a1- and a2-DEMs have separate files and there are separate files for each 128x128 tile.
Tiles are written after the flat plates are warped to form smooth surfaces in smooth areas, so the output should look identical to the Fusion3D display.
<P>
I scaled the data by 0.01 since I thought that might look best on the Rift.
However, it is probably better to scale in the Rift code rather than in the Fusion3D output, so I will probably change that.
<P>
The option is turned on using the tag 'Map3d-Obj-Write' -- see the Tagged Ascii doc in the users manual.

I chose the Belgium dataset as the test example, centered where I do the comparison with QT.
The MrSID hi-res texture is written as a .bmp file attached to the main .obj file.
The outputs are in dir F:/Belgium.
<P>
I wrote out 9 tiles for the first test.
