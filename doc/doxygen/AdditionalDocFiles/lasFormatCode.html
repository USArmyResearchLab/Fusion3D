<H2><A NAME="las_intro">INTRODUCTION</A></H2>

The code was originally written for gridding -- converting point clouds in .las format into DSMs.
The gridding technique used by BuckEye and others was very poor for our purposes and the approach used here is much better
(see various Dammann papers and symposium presentations).
<P>
The code has grown haphazerdly to encompass many other data processing jobs --
basically anything I thought would muddle the basic Fusion3D code.

<H3><A NAME="las_grid">Call Format from Program Fusion3D</A></H3>

Program lasFormat can be called from the Fusion3D viewer using a menu "Point Cloud" -> "Make DEM from Point Cloud".
This option only works for
This triggers a call to lasFormat using the following parameters:
<PRE>

C:\\Fusion3D\\bin\\lasFormat.exe
	-igrid	Name of first input .las file
	-igrid	Name of second input .las file, if present
	...
	-igrid	Name of last input .las file, if present
	-oa2		Name of output a2-DEM file in GeoTiff (a1-DEM and intensity files are made from this using BuckEye conventions)
			WARNING -- the name must contain the sequence '_a2_' in order to make the other output names
	-res		Output resolution (post spacing) for DEMs
	-tauth	Used only where the quality metric TAU is available for the point cloud, uses only points above this threshold
	-a1th 3.0	Used iff high-noise sensor, this 
	-imax		Max intensity for output intensity file

See documentation on Change Detection for a description of this function.

<H2><A NAME="las_nitf">CONVERSION OF NITF FILES TO GEOTIFF FORMAT</A></H2>

The program can convert a NITF .ntf file into a GeoTiff format using GDAL driver to read the NITF.

<H2><A NAME="las_mrsid">CROP MRSID IMAGE AND OUTPUT TO GEOTIFF</A></H2>

The program can crop a MrSID image and output to a GeoTiff.
Since MrSID is a proprietary format, I can read it but cannot write to it.  So it has be be GeoTiff.
When MrSID images are converted GeoTiff, they are typically too large to process or use.
So cropping is almost always necessary.
<P>
One way to crop and write is using a MrSID utility mrsidgeodecode.
This does the reading, cropping and writing in  one operation.
Another way is to use my MrSID classes to do the reading and writing.
This is more coding but may be more flexible.
