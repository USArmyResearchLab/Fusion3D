QT can convert .bpf files into LAS files.
However, the intensity information is lost when this is done, so the resulting LAS file is location only.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="ps_composite">EXAMPLES OF COMPOSITING OF MANY IMAGES FOR TARGET-MODE DATA COLLECTS</A></H2>

These images were given to me in December 2012.
It appears they are from a test set that was given to a number of researchers to test out their compositing algorithms.
<P>
Stereo is useful in display of the original point cloud.
Pender scene shows lots of detail in the canopy -- tree trunks, branches and leaves -- that is obviously real. This cant be discerned in QT mono.
This shows that Paul's algorithm is identifying and keeping the real objects thru the noise even tho the scene is very complex.
Looking at the Haiti scene in stereo also shows lots of infomation not visible in the mono image.
We made a still of Haiti with anaglyph that I gave to Paul.
<P>
The DEMs are sometimes useful, sometimes not.
The most useful in elYunque where it brings out buildings not evident in the point cloud.
The least useful is Pender where the scene is too complex to pull out the targets -- the a2 surface gets the ground rather than the targets.
Maybe this could be fixed.
<P>

npu_campRoberts_highRes.bpf		Flat deserty area with test objects -- some at different heights, some not?  -- 2 triangles, squares, tent? truck
						Gridding:  Res=0.10m, elev threshold = 2m, max intensity = 256
						TAU limits are bad
						Targets: big target is row of triangle struts at decreasing intervals -- should be ground-level between struts

npu_elYunque_highRes.bpf		Heavy tree cover, road and path
						Gridding:  Res=0.33m, elev threshold = 3m, max intensity = 96

npu_haiti_highRes.bpf			Haiti, tents under heavy tree cover
						Gridding:  Res=0.33m, elev threshold = 3m, max intensity = 96
						Tau slider not helpful
						15 looks too noisy

npu_nts10_highRes.bpf			Very flat in middle with objects only in intensity, not elevation

npu_nts15_highRes.bpf			Similar to previous file
						Gridding:  Res=0.20m, elev threshold = 2m, max intensity = 256
						Res=0.1m was tried but that was very noisy -- 0.2m is much much better
						Targets:  intensity only -- should not show elevation difference

npu_pender5_highRes.bpf			Very heavy tree cover -- only a few points below treetops
						Gridding:  Res=0.33m, elev threshold = 3m, max intensity = 96
						Taken at 2 altitudes
						Targets:  First is row of square targets canted at 45 deg elev and with diminishing spacing just East of gully, north half
							Second is elevated horizontal triangle in southwest quad west of gully
							Third is boxes -- we could not find these objects
							Found 9 targets from ground truth file

npu_pender9_highRes.bpf			Similar to previous file
						Gridding:  Res=0.33m, elev threshold = 3m, max intensity = 96
						Tau slider not helpful

adj_18N_Pender_Ground_Truth.bpf	Ground truth for Pender scene ~19M points taken from fixed ground-based units at several locations
						I can find 15 objects -- stored in file 'penderTargetsEd.kml' where I have added target names to my bookmarks.

	Primary Point	Stereo very useful in picking out targets -- the better the data, the more stereo helps

	Secondary Point:	Filtered in elevation for better vis of the ground


</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="ps_pender">Pender Composite</A></H3>
I did Pender5 with a natural color scale and default color-scale limits.
I did Pender9 with a red-blue color scale and limits that accentuate objects near the ground.
<PRE>

	Primary Point	Stereo shows that Paul's algorithm is locking onto real structure rather than just random stuff
				You can see targets he has found

	Secondary Point:	Filtered in elevation for better vis of the ground

	Primary Point	DEM very useful here, showing more buildings than apparent in point cloud -- sometimes less in more

	Secondary Point:	Filtered in elevation relative to DEM is better but still needs work


</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="ps_haiti">Haiti</A></H3>
<PRE>

	Primary Point	DEM works well here -- captures about as much and is easier to see

	Secondary Point:	Can see some features with entire point cloud not obvious without it

ElYunque and Haiti represent the most typical data since they are complex and wooded and would most likely 
require compositing.

The resolution of the gridding is very important.  Owing to the relatively high noise level, gridding at too fine a level causes a chaotic surface --
smooth surfaces like test areas dont come out smooth.
So you want to grid more conservatively that for linear sensors like Buckeye that are much less noisy.

I got these images from the Machete Program.

<H3><A NAME="machete1">First Group of Machete Images</A></H3>

I got images about 21 February 2014.
The images are from El Yunque.  They are for the same area images by ALIRT several years earlier.
Unfortunately, the scene has changed dramatically -- most of the buildings in the earlier scene have caved in --
that a comparison is impossible.
I have Project files from both ALIRT and MACHETE.
<P>



<H3><A NAME="machete1">Second Group of Machete Images</A></H3>

I received an image about 19 May 2014 -- "150145N0842013W_MACHETE1_PT_20140514_035111_000_000_025_HAG_combined.bpf".
I put it in F:\Fopen2.
