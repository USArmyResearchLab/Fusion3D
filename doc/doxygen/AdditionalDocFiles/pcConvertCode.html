<H1>PCCONVERT CODE FOR CONVERTING POINT-CLOUD FILES IN ASCII FORMAT TO LAS FORMAT</H1>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="convert_intro">INTRODUCTION</A></H2>

This code is no longer maintained.
The code works but will probably never be needed again.
However, it is there if ever we need it or want to lift something from it.
<P>
The code was originally written to convert ascii point-cloud files to LAS format for several maps of Lithuania.
This map was made for ARCIC for a wargaming exercise in May 2018.
The point-cloud data was given to us in ASCII format (owing to miscommunication or mistake).
We did not have time to go through the requesting process again, so I coded the conversion.
Unfortunately, the data provided was for bare earth, so the map was never used.
<P>
The code reads each input file and creates a corresponding file in LAS format.

As with the gridder program, a virtually unlimited number of point-cloud files can be input.
However, due to a basic limitation in the Windows utilities, only a limited number can be chosen at a time.
They must be chosen in groups of about 150 at most.
If more than this number must be chosen, several groups can be chosen consecutively and the result will be the sum of all the input groups.
<P>
An output file is created from each input file, so the process can be done in batches as large as desired.
