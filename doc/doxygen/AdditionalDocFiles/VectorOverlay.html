In August 2018, I reimplemented the vector overlay to consolodate the code and give all vector overlays the same structure.
All classes that process vector data use the draw_data_class class to store vector data and the draw_data_inv_class child class to draw the data.
The class draw_data_class has a structure that closely follows the KML structure.
It implements a subset of the KML spec as needed by the current viewer and will be extended as new features require.
<P>
Most functionality was retained.
However, some of the capability in the truth_manager_class was not incorporated in other classes, namely the ability to follow a track in time.
The draw_data_class class can store time info and has the capability to get location at an arbitrary data index (actually at any point between indices as well).
The interval_calc_class complements it by calculating the data index given the time series from the draw_data_class.
I also added an averaging capability to the draw_data_class (storing average locations in a new array structure).
<P>
I transfered all of the functionality of the time_track_class to the draw_data_class.
It is still called in roi_manager_class and in cadmodel_manager_class.
The roi_manager_class has not been used for a long time and just needs to be rewritten using the new classes.
Likewise for the cadmodel_manager_class which was used to move model people along a track for a demo but has not been used in a long time.
<P>
The clock management also needs to be transfered from the truth_manager_class to the draw_manager_inv_class.
<P>
Joe Mullins wants to add the capability in draw to move units along routes.
The speed of each unit would have to be defined.
It appears that the way to implement would be to define the start time and the speed and move the unit at that speed until it reached the objective.
<P>
A potential problem is that the route would be defined in a very gross way with a smooth route for high-level or large-area presentation.
It would be defined much more detailed along roads/valleys etc. at a lower-level or smaller-scale presentation.
These may conflict and a unit would really want to move along the more detailed route.

<H2><A NAME="vector_fun">VECTOR OVERLAY FUNCTIONALITY</A></H2>
<PRE>

	Point		Can have name, symbol or time associated
			Default is to draw symbol if present; if no symbol, draw name if present, if neither draw point itself
			has altitude-mode

	Line		Can have time associated with each point, a symbol or cadmodel associated with a mover along that line
			has altitude-mode
			No name or symbol -- must define a separate point for these

	Circle	Just defined as a line within the code

	Polygon	Just defined as a line within the code


</PRE>




<H2><A NAME="vector_draw">NEW VECTOR OVERLAY IMPLEMENTATION USING draw_data_inv_class</A></H2>

<PRE>

	Reimplemented
		draw_manager_inv_class
			Pro		Mix of multiple lines, points, polygons, circles and symbols
					Can add, move or delete features
			Con		Movers along lines has been partially implemented but not finished

		sensor_kml_manager_inv_class
			Pro		Sensor hit points
					Draws most-current sensor FOV specified by polygon
			Con		Only implemented for ARL-India sensor

		kml_manager_inv_class
			Pro		Can handle multiple input files with mixtures of points, lines, polygons and symbols	
					Can toggle on and off individual files
			Con		No editing capability

		track_manager_inv_class
			Pro		Can 'fly' along a line with averaging of position and heading
					Can add, move and delete points from a single line
			Con		Can only handle one line at a time
					Cant handle points or symbols

		bookmark_manager_inv_class
			Pro		Can digitize bookmarks, label them, save them and read them
					Can jump to up to 4 bookmarks using buttons generated in this class
			Con		Can only handle points -- no lines or symbols

		script_input_class	Still uses time_track_class to implement averaging of location and heading
			Pro		Can fly along a line
			Con		Must fly at constant speed -- time = distance

	Superceded
		time_track_class		Still used in roi_manager_class and cadmodel_manager_class but could be replaced

	Abandoned
		truth_manager_class	Still old structure -- no current use but has capabilities for animation with time 

		place_point_class		Still old structure -- no current use

<H3><A NAME="vector_read">Reading Vector Overlay Files</A></H2>
<PRE>

	kml	Should be most flexible and general-purpose

	shp	Crude and outmoded but widely used still, so need to read it

	osm	Open Street Map format to add landmarks for context

	sbet	Applanix ascii format that was used vehicle track for BuckEye ground-based ladar in Fredericksburg

	csv	Only implemented for LORD gps tracker file used by ARL MEMS-Scanned ladar

	txt	Only from Project File, reads my old text format for saving tracks so kept for backwards compatibility



</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="vector_write">Writing Vector Overlay Files</A></H2>
<PRE>

	KML		Only format currently fully implemented for most vector overlay output

	shp-LOS	I think this still write LOS using my code

	shp		I have a limited implementation using the OGR library but have not fully checked it out and not wired it into the viewer
