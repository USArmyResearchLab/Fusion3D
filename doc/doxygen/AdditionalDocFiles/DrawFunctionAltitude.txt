FUSION3D DRAW FUNCTION NOTES

ALTITUDE
Altitudes of all lines and points are kept as absolute values.  When a point is digitized, by default it is assigned the altitude of the map at that point.
This altitude can be modified in several ways as described below, but always stored as absolute values.
The altitudes are stored in KML as absolute values.
Altitudes are drawn slightly above their altitudes so they show up well on the terrain.  This offset is a parameter that can be set in the project file.

ALTITUDE MODS
From the menu, one can modify the altitude of the current feature (line or point),
setting it either to an absolute altitude or a relative altitude where every point is the specified distance above the altitude of the map at that point.
When digitizing a line, all previous previous points digitized for that line will be adjusted to the new altitude and all subsequent points for that line will also be adjusted.
When digitizing a point, the adjustment will apply to the current highlighted point which will be the point just digitized.
So the height adjustment must be made after the point is digitized rather then before.

INTERUPTING DIGITIZING WITH OTHER FUNCTIONS
When digitizing is interrupted, by something like measuring elevations or setting bookmarks, use the menu entry 'initiate draw' to turn off the other function and resume drawing.
