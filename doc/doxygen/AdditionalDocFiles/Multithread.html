I have implemented several different multithreading options that can be used either separately or together.
They are controlled by a tag 'Map3d-Update' in the parameter file.
There is always the main thread that implements the user interface and traverses the OpenInventor object tree to visualize.
There may also be one or more worker threads that make portions of new areas of the map as needed.
<P>

	COIN
		To use threads, one must rebuild the Coin Library (see below)
			To turn on Coin threadsafe, we set the Preprocessor variable COIN_THREADSAFE in building Coin.


	VSG/FEI
		Init is different with and without threads -- to use threads init the OpenInventor library with the following:
			SoWin::threadInit(myWindow);

	Both
		SoDB::threadInit();	??? What does this do?  is it necessary in either lib?

<H2><A NAME="thread_intro">THREAD SAFE MECHANISM FOR GRAPHICS</A></H2>

This protects the basic graphics tree.
Both COIN and VSG provide basic functions to protect the tree so that a worker thread can modify the tree 
without interfering with the main thread that traverses the tree.
The worker will be blocked until the traversal is finished, then locks out any other reads of the tree until it is finished and unlocks.
<P>

</PRE>
<H2><A NAME="thread_intro">NEW THREAD SAFE MECHANISM FOR NON-GRAPHICS</A></H2>

The new approach that I am experimenting with makes individual classes thread safe rather than
handling thread safety at the global level.
Protection is done within classes.
It also tries to use multiple mutexes to protect the smallest feasible groups of data
rather than the old method that used only 2 for much broader groups.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="thread_intro">Status of Thread Safe Mechanisms</A></H3>

I had to do extensive changes to implement the various mutex-oriented thread-safety changes.
Something I did resulted in a bug that I could not track down, even after several days work.
So I reverted back to rev 5.44 which had cache_class changes but did not have changes for map3d_index_class or tiles_rtv_class.
<P>
<PRE>

Changes to rev 5.44

	Add new methods
		map3d_index_class->is_elev_intersection(double roi_cen_north, double roi_cen_east, float roi_size_y, float roi_size_x);
			This is thread-safe and simpler -- used instead of calc_roi_intersections()
			Wired into some classes but not all
		map3d_index_class->dealloc_elev2();
			No thread-safety effects

	Added code but did not implement thread-safe features
		map3d_index_class->get_elev_safe(double roi_cen_north, double roi_cen_east, float roi_size_y, float roi_size_x, int which_flag, int exec_smoothing_flag, int lowres_flag);
			This thread-vulnerable tasks into single method that can be more easily thread-safed
			Code kept but not wired into other classes

	Modified call sequence but did not implement new thread-safety
		map3d_index_class->get_elev_at_pt(double north, double east, int external_safe_flag, float &elev_a2);


<H3><A NAME="thread_intro">CLASS cache_class</A></H3>

Status variables are protected by a mutex so that only a single user can read/write them.
The storage area is protected while writing by setting the stat array for that tile to 2 before starting to write and setting it to 1 on completion.
That stat array is then checked that it is 1 before reading.
The storage area is protected for later reading since it will never be deleted until it out of the display area.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="thread_intro">CLASS map3d_index_class</A></H3>

<H4><A NAME="thread_intro">Elevation Data </A></H4>

Elevation data is protected either by an internal mutex or by calling lock and unlock methods from calling classes that set the mutex.
The internal mutex is used when only a single point elevation (or 2) is needed such done in mensuration.
Locking and unlocking methods are called when elevations for a group of points are needed such as pinning a ground track to the terrain elevation.
<P>
<PRE>

	Multithread users for hi-res tiles

		Main thread				Gets elevations for point or group of points such as mensuration

	Protected
		data arrays data_a2 and data_a1
		smoothing flags smooth_flags
		parms of current roi
		which tiles intersect (including method map3d_index->calc_roi_intersections())

	Concept
		The lock method is called
		A block of elevation data is read
		The data is consumed -- transfered to cache, or a point-elevation is extracted, etc
		The unlock method can then be called since the data is no longer needed

	get_elev_at_pt(double north, double east, int external_safe_flag, float &elev_a2);
		map3d_index_class::elev_mutex_lock()		Locks before a group of points is processed
		map3d_index_class::get_elev_at_pt(double north, double east, int external_safe_flag, float &elev_a2);
			Called with external_safe_flag=1 		indicates that thread safing done external to class
		map3d_index_class::elev_mutex_unlock()		Unlocks after group is processed

			ladar_mm_manager_inv_class:			Cull points very near ground level
			track_manager_class: 				Pin line (multiple points) to ground before drawing it

		OR

		map3d_index_class::get_elev_at_pt(double north, double east, int external_safe_flag, float &elev_a2);
			Called with external_safe_flag=0		Indicates thread safing is internal to this method

			kml_manager_inv_class:				Display single point?
			los_manager_inv_class:				Display sensor loc (on tower)
			los_manager_inv_class:				Draw a line from sensor to single loc
			mensuration_manager_inv_class:		Find elev of picked pt or difference between 2 points
			track_manager_inv_class:			Edit track -- Add or move a point
		

	get_elev(int which_flag, int exec_smoothing_flag, int lowres_flag);

			atr_los_class::read_a2_image:			Read block of elevations, then transfer to local storage
			atr_los_class::make_mask():			Read block of elevations, then create shadow mask -- 	KEEPS LOCK FOR A LONG TIME
			image_rtv_class:					No longer used -- do nothing

<H3><A NAME="thread_tiles_rtv_class">CLASS tiles_rtv_class -- Hi-Res Tile Building Status</A></H4>

Class tiles_rtv_class maintains the status of the building of hi-res tiles, med-res tiles and low-res tiles.
Only the hi-res needs to be protected since that is the only one presently accessed by multiple threads.
<PRE>

		get_nnew_hi(int iMark)
		mark_tile_hi(int iSpatial, int iMark)
		get_Sep_status_hi(int iSep)

	Concept
		The next new tile is indentified and marked as under construction -- this is mutex protected
		Tile data (MrSID texture or elevation) is read and added to tile -- this does not need to be protected
		The data for the new tile is marked as complete -- this is mutex protected

</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="thread_intro">LOS Calculations</A></H3>

LOS calculations use A2 elevations.
These are protected using the elevation data safing described in map3d_index_class.
<P>
It also produces masks. 
These are not protected -- it is very unlikely to produce a conflict and I think any corrupted data would be overwritten.

Multithreading is useful because maps can be much larger than can be accomodated in the hardware.
Because of memory constraints with a 32-bit operating system and on the graphics card,
only a portion of large map can displayed.
Also, 3 different levels of detail are employed, high at the center and lower for areas further from the center.
Maps are broken up into small tiles.
When the user moves off the center portion of the map, new tiles around the new center of the map are read and processed and 
furthest away tiles are discarded to conserve memory.
Worker threads speed up this process of creating new portions of the map.
<P>
1. The first option is a worker thread that does all the tile updating.
This option works with the VSG version of the viewer, since that library is thread-safe for different threads modifying objects
and traversing the object tree.
The option does not work reliably on the Coin-3d version of the viewer, since that library is not thread-safe.
<P>
2.  The second option is a worker thread that does reading and decoding of MrSID-encoded high-resolution orthophoto texture.
This process is CPU-intensive where most of the other tile-making processes are IO-intensive.
<P>
3.  A third option is not truly multithreading, but has much the same effect.
It allows the low-resolution tiles to be made by the main thread in the background -- only when the user interface is
not active.
Without an SSD and when data is being read for the first time,
making the low-res tiles can much slower that making the high-res and medium-res tiles.
This allows the user to view and manipulate the center portion of the image as the low-res edges are being constructed.

When there is multithreading it is necessary to use SoDB::threadinit rather than SoDB::init.
This init is done for the main thread in lsensor_world using a parm from sw_parms_class:

<PRE>
	Default			sw_parms_class		init for multithreading
	Map3d-Update	0	sw_parms_class		init for single thread

<H2><A NAME="thread_history">HISTORY</A></H2>

In October 2007, I implemented a simple form of multi-threading.
The purpose was to avoid the display freezing while batches of new tiles are made.
When moving within the low-res map, the user can move immediately to a new area after he clicks on it
and can view the low-res map while med-res tiles are building.
Before multithreading, he would have to wait for all new tiles to be constructed before moving.
When moving outside the low-res map, he can now move immediately and can begin to do useful work
after the hi-res tiles are up rather than having to wait much longer for all tiles.
<P>
I only implemented 2 threads.
The second worker thread only constructs new tiles -- it reads the data from disk, does the processing
necessary to determine smooth areas and constructs the OpenInventor object for each tile.
The primary thead does everything else -- it handles user inputs, does calculations like track registration 
and LOS.
When it needs to access map data, it requests that the worker thread pause so thread safety is assured.
The worker thread is launched on program initialization and runs continually until map3dview is terminated.
It continually tests whether new tiles are needed and, if so, makes them as fast as it can.
<P>
The Mercury OIV on Windows implements threading and claims to be completely thread-safe.
It has a writelock/writeunlock that I put around the appropriate parts of the code
to ensure that only 1 thread accesses objects at a time.
<P>
On the SGI I used Posix pthreads.
The SGI OIV is not thread-safe as far as I know and I was not careful using mutexes, etc.
I really dont care if this crashes occasionally on the SGI since I
will only be doing debugging and not using the multi-thread option for real work here.
<P>
I implemented 3 options:
Option 0 is the original technique with a single thread that makes the user wait until
all tiles are updated before the display is updated.
<P>
Option 1 has a single thread, but updates in the background only when OIV is not busy.
The trick here is to balance the tile updates with display refreshes.
If you make too few tiles at a time, tile update is very slow.
If you make too many, the tile update process monopolizes the processor making
user response very slow.
I have not found a decent balance between the two that significantly improves performance over
the old method, so this option is not yet useful.
<P>
Option 2 is dual-thread, where the user can continue to interact with the display as 
the second thread updates the tiles.
The trick here is not to allow the display to refresh too often --
if you allow it to refresh after each tile is created (my first thought),
the huge number of refreshes makes the update impossibly long.
You have to update a bunch of tiles, then refresh.
My current technique updates the med-res tiles in a single batch.
It updates the low-res tiles in 2 batches --
the first just a few tiles around the med-res section, then all the rest in the second batch.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="thread_avoid">AVOIDING CONFLICTS</A></H2>

Normal tile creation is protected with the Mercury writelock/writeunlock as described above.
<P>



<H3><A NAME="thread_avoid_2">Tasks Outside map3d_manager_inv_class</A></H2>

The track-registration, LOS and mensuration tasks require tile data and may crash if not protected in multithread.
I have defined a global variable GL_busy (see beloe and doc for global variables) to do this coordination.
If there is no multithreading GL_busy is set to 0.
If there is multithreading GL_busy is positive.
It is 1 in the normal mode.
A task that needs exclusive use of the processors sets GL_busy to 2;
Then the worker thread pauses and sets it to 3.
Now the task in the main thread can be executed without conflict.
When finished, the task sets GL_busy back to 1 allowing the worker thread to resume.
<P>




<H2><A NAME="thread_gl_busy">THE COIN3D SUPPORT</A></H2>

<H3><A NAME="thread_gl_busy">Turning on Coin Threadsafe</A></H3>

To turn on Coin threadsafe, we set the Preprocessor variable COIN_THREADSAFE in building Coin.
We first tried to do this in the Properties, but that did not work -- the variable was still unset.
We then set it explicitly in a .h file and that seemed to do the trick.
<P>
Before we set the variable, the code would crash, usually on moving after a few mouse clicks.

<H3><A NAME="thread_gl_busy">Documentation Notes</A></H3>

From the Coin3d doc (Coin-2):
<pre>

From email 5/5/2010 from Tom Fredrik Klaussen SIM

	My question:  The second is multithreading.  It appears from your documentation that
	multithreading is implemented but not turned on as a default.
	  
	His answer:  Rendering traversals are guaranteed to be thread-safe. There are other aspects of Coin that we know are thread-safe,
	but we make no guarantees in this regard. It needs to be enabled, since it incurs a small overhead.

From SIM doc -- I think from Version 2:
The support in Coin for using multiple threads in application programs and the Coin library itself, consists of two main features: 
Coin provides platform-independent thread-handling abstraction classes. These are classes that the application programmer can freely
use in her application code to start new threads, control their execution, work with mutexes and do other tasks related to handling multiple threads. 
The classes in question are SbThread, SbMutex, SbStorage, SbBarrier, SbCondVar, SbFifo, SbThreadAutoLock, SbRWMutex, and SbTypedStorage.
See their respective documentation for the detailed information. 
The classes fully hides the system-specific implementation, which is either done on top of native Win32 (if on Microsoft Windows),
or over POSIX threads (on UNIX and UNIX-like systems). 
The other aspect of our multi-threading support is that Coin can be specially configured so that rendering traversals of the scene graph are done
in a thread-safe manner. This means e.g. that it is possible to have Coin render the scene in parallel on multiple CPUs for multiple rendering pipes,
to better take advantage of such high-end systems (like CAVE environments, for instance). 
Thread-safe render traversals are off by default, because there is a small overhead involved which would make rendering
(very) slightly slower on single-threaded invocations. 
To get a Coin library built with thread-safe rendering, one must actively re-configure Coin and build a special, local version.
For configure-based builds (UNIX and UNIX-like systems, or with Cygwin on Microsoft Windows) this is done with the option "--enable-threadsafe"
to Autoconf configure. For how to change the configuration and re-build with Visual Studio, get in touch with us at "coin-support@coin3d.org". 
There are some restrictions and other issues which it is important to be aware of: 
We do not yet provide any support for binding the multi-threaded rendering support into the SoQt / SoWin / etc GUI bindings,
and neither do we provide bindings against any specific library that handles multi-pipe rendering.
This means the application programmer will have to possess some expertise, and put in some effort, to be able to utilize multi-pipe rendering with Coin. 
Rendering traversals is currently the only operation which we publicly support to be thread-safe.
There are other aspects of Coin that we know are thread-safe, like most other action traversals beside just rendering,
but we make no guarantees in this regard. 
Be careful about using a separate thread for changing Coin structures versus what is used for the application's GUI event thread. 
We are aware of at least issues with Qt (and thereby SoQt), where you should not modify the scene graph in any way in a thread
separate from the main Qt thread. This because it will trigger operations where Qt is not thread-safe.

The main thread does everything except build the individual tiles, done in the worker thread.
Many tasks that require reading/writing the map are explicitly protected by GL_busy (see above).
The only thing not protected this way is updating the map.
<P>
The updating process is probably very inefficient and can be streamlined.
You want to update only those tiles done in specific pass
(either med-res, or the inner ring of low-res or the outer ring of low-res).
