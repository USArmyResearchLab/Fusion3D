<H2><A NAME="icons_intro">INTRODUCTION</A></H2>

There are 2 basically similar standards for military icons -- 2525B/C which is for the US and NATO APP6B.
They are heirarchical and can define procedurally a large number of different icons based on different attributes.
They span the entire universe of military things, so they tend to be pretty broad categories.
<P>
I have not been able to find a c++ library that creates icons and also this would require a lot of programming to
make a rather complex menu to construct the icons.
So, at least for the short term, I have decided to create icons external to Fusion3D and use the images in the code.


<H2><A NAME="icons-micro">CREATING THE ICONS WITH MICRODEM</A></H2>

I downloaded Microdem to the Bang and Olafson computer in 3F061.  It is installed with microdem_setup.exe which runs standalone.
However when you first start it, it asks for additional files from the net. Apparently, you dont need these files to use the icon generator
but it does ask you for them each time you start Microdem -- a pain.
I downloaded the requested .dbf files and that fixed the problem.
I installed Microdem on the development machine in 3F061, then copied the .dbf files from the B&O machine and it worked properly.
<P> 
It uses basic symbols from MAPSYMBS.COM in the form of 'fonts' so these fonts have to be loaded also or all the useful symbols dont appear.
<p>
You access the icon composer by running Microdem, clicking the 'file' menu, the 'tools' submenu and the 'Military icon generator'.
You should see 5 tabs, starting with the 'FR land'.  If you only see 2 starting with 'DRMS' then the MAPSYMBS.COM symbols have not been recognized.
<p>
You can save files as BMP, JPEG, GIF, and PNG.
<p>

These are the basic symbols used by Microdem.
As I understand it, each symbol is a letter in a font and the font is scalable so the output can be any size desired.
<P>
Licensing for commercial use is questionable, but it looks like there is no license required for Fusion3D as long is it doesn't become a commercial product.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="icons-spatial">POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVE:  CREATING THE ICONS WITH SPATIAL ILLUSIONS</A></H2>

Spatial Illusions has a java library for creating icons procedurally and also a web-based applications that generates them for download.
<PRE>

	1.  Spatial Illusions (spatialillusions.com) has a browser-based code that will generate icons based on a number of attributes
		selected from pull-down menus

	2.  Right-click on the icon to save it as a .png file -- BUT SECURITY APPARENTLY BLOCKS DOWNLOAD ON ARL NETWORK

<H2><A NAME="icons-save">SAVING THE SYMBOLS FOR ACCESS BY FUSION3D</A></H2>

Fusion3D looks for military symbols in a subdirectory of its bin directory: bin/milSymbols.
It requires a BMP image file for each symbol.
One should specify a standard size in Microdem when saving symbols, but the symbols are typically different sizes,
most larger than the specified size.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="icons-access">ACCESSING THE SYMBOLS FROM FUSION3D</A></H2>

Fusion3D has a menu that shows all the military symbols in directory bin/milSymbols.
One can choosed the desired symbol from this menu.
The menu can accomodata over 100 symbols, but is fixed size.  If there are too many symbols, some symbols may not appear.
<P>
At this point, the menu appears whenever you digitize a point feature in the draw feature.

<H2><A NAME="icons-save">SAVING THE ICONS TO KML</A></H2>

Icons can be placed on the map using KML files
