The Fusion3D 3-D terrain viewer is oriented toward terrain visualization.
It attempts to render the terrain in the most intuitive and visually direct way possible to facilitate human perception.
It should be useful for situation awareness, mission planning and other situations where human understanding of terrain is important.
It also has capabilities for line of sight and highlighting of vertical obstructions.
Vertical obstruction highlighting makes checking flight paths and landing zones much faster and more reliable.
<P>
The rendering technique, unique to this viewer, provides many of the visual benefits of a point cloud while keeping
the small size and useful ordering of the DSM.
Fusion3D is a constrained viewer and navigation should be done as described below.
These features are described in somewhat more detail below and much more thoroughly in the introductory tutorials and user manual
provided with the code.
<P>






<H2><A NAME="ps_install">FUSION3D INSTALLATION</A></H2>

The viewer, Fusion3D, can be simply copied onto your machine -- it does not need to be installed.
The resultant directory tree should look something like:

<PRE>

	C:\Fusion3D\bin			Contains executable and all libraries that are required
	C:\Fusion3D\doc			Contains documentation including introductory tutorials
	C:\Fusion3D\data\scene	Contains a Project File and Digital Surface Models (DEMs) and point clouds for the scene

</PRE>


Independent libraries used are included in the distribution.




<H2><A NAME="ps_sample">SAMPLE MAP WITH PROJECT FILE IN SUBDIRECTORY DATA/SCENE</A></H2>

Project Files have the suffix '.s4d'.
Digital Surface Models (DSMs), point clouds, associated vector overlays, and bookmarks can be loaded or created, then the entire ensemble saved as a Project File.
They can be loaded by clicking on the 'File' Menu at the top-left of the main window, then clicking on the 'Open Project'.
<P>
Project Files are plain text, man-readable and can be edited with Wordpad, Notepad or any other simple text editor.
They consist of tags (that must start a line) and accompanying parameters.
<P>

A sample scene is provided for basic testing of the Fusion3D viewer.
The scene is a rural area in New York that contains a road with a few houses, fields and an area with tree cover.
It was obtained from the LiDARUSA website, lidarusa.com, that contains a number of freely downloadable lidar datasets.
This point-cloud dataset, according to their website, was "Captured with snoopy A-Series mounted on a Drone.
The data is tiled so it isn't huge.  Colorized with world imagery and classified.  We are only
using a small percentage of the available lasers for this view."
<P>
The Fusion3D viewer is capable of ingesting very large maps but we used only the A1 tile of the 4 available,
and further cropped the point cloud to minimize the Fusion3D distribution download.
We derived DSMs from the downloaded A1 point cloud using an Army Research Lab (ARL) developed gridding utility.
This utility produces two DSMs:  a last-hit (a2) DSM and a first-hit (a1) DSM
Note that the Fusion3D viewer can display both DSM's simultaneously -- a feature that we think is unique among terrain viewers
-- and that the a1-DSM can be toggled on or off with a viewer button.
<P>
The point cloud was cropped to the upper-left corner of the image to minimize size.
It was also culled with another ARL utility to eliminate point-cloud points very near the last-hit DSM.
This is not necessary for the viewer but was done to illustrate how the DSM and point cloud can be used together.
It has 2 advantages:  It reduces the cloud size (and total dataset size) by about half and it also reduces visual clutter.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="ps_nav">BASIC NAVIGATION</A></H2>

The viewer is constrained so that the user maintains heads-up, does not go below the terrain, and maintains proper stereo perspective as he moves.
Therefore the user should use the mouse and thumbwheels only and NOT use the alt-mouse functions associated with general OpenInventor Viewer motion.
The user moves (translates) by left-mouse clicking on a location to center that location on the screen.
The thumbwheels are used to zoom and pan and the mouse wheel can also be used to zoom.
The viewer is also set up to use 3DConnection Space Navigator, which is a cheap and very effective way to zoom and pan.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="ps_stereo">STEREO</A></H2>

The Fusion3D viewer is designed to use a stereo display using Nvidia-style quadbuffered stereo.
You should definitely try it if you can.
The stereo implementation entails much more than simply turning on stereo;
the focus point for the stereo and the degree of stereo separation are adjusted as the user moves so that correct stereo is maintained 
without need for additional user effort.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="ps_render">RENDERING TECHNIQUE</A></H2>

The terrain is rendered with a patented technique that is a hybrid of the standard method of draping a DSM and a point-cloud rendering.
Smooth areas of the DSM terrain are draped in the same way that other viewers do.
Fields, roads, rooftops and other smooth surfaces are rendered as smooth.
Rough areas like trees and discontinuities like light/power poles, wires, fences and other manmade features are rendered more like point clouds.
The hybrid technique captures the best features of both the DSM and point cloud.
As far as we know, this approach is unique to the Fusion3D viewer.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="ps_sample">TEXTURE</A></H2>

In the Fusion3D viewer, the resolution of the texture is independent of the DSM resolution.
So, whereas many other viewers restrict the texture resolution to match that of the elevation DSM,
Fusion3D displays the texture at full resolution.
Since the texture may have as much as ten times the DSM resolution, this significantly improves the display.
<P>
