The assimp library is a C++ implementation for importing CAD models in many popular formats.
In particular, it supports Collada (.dae) and Wavefront Object (.obj).
There is a list of about 30 other formats so it is very general
Other advantages are that it is self-contained and does not require loading lots of other libraries
and that it puts data into a structure that is very similar to OpenGL so it does not require
lots of additional transformations for use to use it.

Assimp provides source code and CMAKE files for building the library.
I downloaded assimp source and CMAKE files.
I then downloaded the latest CMAKE for windows:  cmake-3.15.4-win64-x64.
<P>
In the bin subdirectory, I ran the gui-based executable cmake-gui.exe.
I specified the directory for the source code: C/assimp-3.3.1.
I created a directory C:/assimp-3.3.1/build to build in and specified this directory to the GUI.
I pressed "Configure", then "Generate".
I also had to specify to target VisualStudio2017.
This created a VisualStudio 2017 solution that appears to work -- at least for Debug.
<P>
I compiled the Release version 4 December 2019.
I tried both building 'assimp' and building 'BUILD ALL' but had all sorts of linking errors.
It was linking to a 64-bit version of GDAL, not the32-bit version.
When I fixed this, I rebuild 'assimp' and it looks to work.
<P>
Code is in dir:

<PRE>

	C:\assimp-3.3.1\build\code\Debug
	C:\assimp-3.3.1\build\code\Release

The basic data structure is a scene that corresponds to all the data for a single file.
To start processing, one imports data from a file into the scene.
Within the scene there are two basic substructures: meshes and materials.
Each scene contains a number of meshes.
Every time a new material is used for faces in the file/scene, then a new mesh is created.
Although a given material may be used multiple times,
every time a different material is applied to a set of faces then a new mesh is defined.
<P>
Some types of information, like colors and filenames for the texture, are defined in materials.
However most is stored in the meshes.
Vertex locations, face definitions, normals and texture coordinates are defined
in the mesh in such a way that they can be transfered directly into OpenGL/OpenInventor structures.
