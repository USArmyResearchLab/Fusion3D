This utility creates a single file from a number of input files.
Its primary function is to create a single low-resolution texture file that can be used to speed up visualization of very large maps.
A secondary function is to merge a number of files without downsampling (see below).
<P>
The code was originally written to make a downsampled mosaic from a group of .tif texture files for the Woson North Korea map.
This map is huge and reading a full-scale texture file for each low-res tile --
reading it, cropping it, then downsampling it -- was taking an unacceptibly long time.
<P>
The resulting texture image will be just large enough to encompass all the input files and will be black in any areas
where there is no input data.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="mosaic_run">THE MOSAIC OPTION</A></H2>

The code moves file-by-file, summing each input pixel from that file into the appropriate (downsampled) mosaic pixel.
Thus every output pixel is the average of all the input pixels that overlap it.
<P>
The code is currently implemented for MrSID and GeoTiff input files and a GeoTiff output file.
It cannot write MrSID files since we do not have a license to write MrSID (only to read these files).
Since the Fusion3D viewer reads the resulting output file only once at full resolution, there is not a significant advantage of MrSID
over GeoTiff anyway.
<P>
A limitation of the current implementation is that it doesn't do well with making a mosaic from grayscale images.
These cant be matched nicely with color MrSID imagery.
Adding false color to the images could be done as it is in the Fusion3D viewer but this would require associated elevation images,
greatly complicating the implementation and the user interface.
The Fusion3D viewer is also not yet capable of adding false color to a grayscale mosaic.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="las_grid">Call Format </A></H3>

The user has the option of either entering from a chosen directory all the files matching a certain pattern, or
he can enter groups of files by selecting them from a browser window.
Currently, the first method can deal with MrSID files or GeoTiff but not a mixture of the 2 since the pattern matching is not general enough.
<P>
The other inputs are the filename for the output file and the desired output resolution.

<H2><A NAME="mosaic_run">MERGE OPTION</A></H2>

The code was extended a little to provide an option to merge multiple files into a single file with no downsampling
and using a simple algorithm.
This option was implemented both for 1-band or 3-band texture images and also for floating point DEM files.
The simple algorithm just processes each file in sequence transfering pixel values from each input pixel to the
corresponding output pixel (except no-data pixels that are ignored).
Thus the value of the output pixel is the last input pixel that was written to it rather that averaging as done with the Mosaicing option.
<P>
The motivation for adding this feature was that some maps that I downloaded for Mars did not work in Fusion3D or in Mosaicr.
The issue is that Fusion3D expects rectangular tiles whose data and boundaries are aligned with fixed latitudes and longitudes.
The Mars tiles has boundaries are aligned with fixed latitudes and longitudes but they overlap.
The actual data do not overlap and the data boundary between tiles is irregular.
The surrounding area in each tile is filled with no-data values.
So Fusion3d was using only 1 of the several files in the overlap areas and using no-data values from this file rather than the proper
data from the adjacent file.
<P>
Merging these files provides a much more regular file and solves the visualization problem with Fusion3D
(as long as the merged files do not get too large).
<P>
