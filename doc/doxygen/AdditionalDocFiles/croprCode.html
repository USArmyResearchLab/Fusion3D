<H1>CROPR CODE FOR CROPPING POINT CLOUDS TO SPECIFIED REGION</H1>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME="cropr_intro">INTRODUCTION</A></H2>

The code is a very simple one designed to reduce the size of point-cloud files.
There are 3 options as described below: to crop a point cloud to a specified region,
to decimate a point cloud (take every nth point) or to thin a point cloud (take only the first point in each voxel).
As implemented, it only accepts point-cloud files in .las format.
<P>
When the files are selected, the total number of points in all the files and the
total extent of the data is shown in the menu.

<H3><A NAME="grid_intro">Cropping</A></H2>

The user can modify the extent information in the menu as desired and the data will be cropped
to the resulting modified parameters.
<P>



<H3><A NAME="cropr_dec">Decimating</A></H2>

The menu contains a decimation ratio.
If the value is 1 (the default) then no decimation is done.
If it is =n larger than 1, then 1 out of every n points is transfered to the output.
The output is every nth point starting with point 0 for each block read.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="cropr_thin">Thinning</A></H2>

The bounding box of the data for each file is divided in all three dimensions into equal-sized voxels.
Only the first hit in any voxel is transfered to the output.
The size of the voxel is set from the menu.
<P>
Advantages over decimating:  Ground-based lidar usually has very different sampling densities varying from very dense
on the ground close to the sensor and much less dense at longer ranges. So this technique compensates for this imbalance
whereas decimating does not.
<P>
Disadvantages:  The resulting number of points cant be determined beforehand, so several passes may be necessary to get a reasonable number.
If multiple files are processed, then you may want different voxel resolutions for different files.  You may want to sample more densely
at the focal point of a data collection than the surrounding areas.
