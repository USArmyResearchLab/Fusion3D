<H2><A NAME="vs2017-license">VISUAL STUDIO 2017 LICENSE</A></H2>

The license needs to be renewed periodically.
I renewed it 10/15/2019.
To do this you need to be connected to the internet. 
It asks you to login -- I logged in as tj71dammann@poetworld.net with passwd CHessie08 (8).
It then automatically updates the license.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="install-dev">Making of LIBJPEG</A></H3>

I had to make libjpeg from source.
I got the source from the net, version 9 (not the latest, but matched some instructions I found).
<PRE>

	in the prompt window, cd to directory C:\jdammann\jpegsr9\jpeg-9 and run commands:

	set INCLUDE=%INCLUDE%;c:\Program Files\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v7.0A\Include
	nmake -f makefile.vc setup-v10

	Then I just made the solution in VC10 and referenced the .h files and .lib file it made

<H3><A NAME="install-dev">Update of GDAL Libraries to Version 10.0</A></H3>

I updated the gdal libraries in late May 2013 to version 10.0. -- the old version was 1.7.1.
I put the new libraries in dir c:\gdal-1.10.0.
I downloaded the source and compiled with the provided VS10 .sln file to make the library and includes.
For some reason, the install part of the build did not work for me, so I made 'lib' and 'include' dirs and
copied the required (cribbed from the makefiles included in the VS10) files into these dirs.
I downloaded a precompiled binaries to get the .dlls -- I did not use the .dll that my build made.
I think that ones that I made did not include options that the precompiled ones did.
<P>
I got an error message -- ordinal 63 missing.
I fixed this by putting the new gdal bin dir at the head of the list for env var path.
I think it was accessing the old gdal .dlls rather that the proper new ones.
<P>
On running, I had another problem -- it still cant read the KML latlonbox,
but does not return NULL like the old libs but returns 0 features instead.
I moded the code to look for both NULL and 0 features and then go to my separate implementation of the latlonbox.
<P>
