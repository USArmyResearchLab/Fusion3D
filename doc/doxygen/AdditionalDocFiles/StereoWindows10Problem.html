1.  Cables must have enough bandwidth to support 1920x1080 at 120 Hz
	This requires a dual-link DVI for ASUS monitor
	The Quadro M4000 in my office tower has only 4 displayPort outputs, so converter required that can support dual DVI
	The converter already on the computer could not -- 120Hz setting did not show up on the Change Resolution menu
		and the display did not flash as it should when starting Fusion3D in stereo
	We have a StarTech DisplayPort to DVI Dual Line Active Converter (originally bought for Eurocom?) which looks to work
		120Hz can be chosen and the display flashes properly -- however, viewer still crashes.

<H2><A NAME="stereotest">STEREOTEST, A VERY SIMPLE OPENGL PROGRAM FOR TESTING 3D STEREO</A></H2>

Stereotest is a simple OpenGL program for testing if 3D stereoscopic viewing works properly within a window on the display screen
(in contrast to "full screen" stereo where images are not contained within a window).
The program tests for basic "stereo-in-a-window" functionality by 1) creating a window, 2) initializing it for OpenGL drawing,
and 3) drawing the background for each eye as a solid color.
There are no dependencies on any graphical user interface, and no 3D drawing.
<P>
The background is a field of red in the left eye and a field of blue in the right eye.
Thus, without 3D glasses you should see a magenta window if the stereo images are superimposed on the display correctly
and with 3D glasses you should see separate background colors in each eye.
If stereotest doesn't display the expected red-in-left-eye and blue-in-right-eye image,
then either the graphics driver isn't configured properly for 3D stereo or there is a hardware problem.
If your graphics card does not support stereo the message "unable to get stereo visual" is output. 
<P>




<H3><A NAME="stereotest-test">Tests of stereotest on My Windows10 Office Desktop</A></H3>


I tested stereotest on my office PC running Windows10 Enterprise with a DoD-standard 'image' that includes lots of security additions.
It has a Quadro M4000 card running 382.59 driver version.
I used a ASUS VG278H monitor with built-in emitter and Nvidia 2nd-gen glasses.
It looks like the first time I run stereotest with the stereo monitor and correct stereo settings, the emitter comes on for a short time
then turns back off.  After that the emitter never turns on again (until a reboot perhaps, as I have seen this behavior several times separated by
weeks during which there was a reboot).
<P>

Hope this is the right place to enter this question.
<P>
We have been using quadbuffered stereo with Quadro cards for a number of years and this is very important for our software package based on OpenInventor.
I have not been able to get the stereo to work on Windows10. I have tried 4 different computers -- 2 laptops and 2 towers -- with 4 different Quadro cards.
I have used an ASUS monitor with built-in emitter, several monitors with separate emitters, and an LG 3D tv. None have worked.
They all show the same symptoms. Whenever the quadbuffered stereo is enabled (in any configuration) the application crashes on starting -- 
it appears to be when the initial window is opened.
<P>
Has anyone been able to get stereo to work on Windows10? I have combed the forum and internet but found no answers.
<P>

Thank you to all who replied. I have some good news for this issue.

Nvidia has a beta QNF driver version 382.05 dated 4 May 2017 and a WHQL release 377.48 from 14 June 2017.
Both of these appear to retain stereo capabilities together with the Windows 10 Creators update.

The WHQL driver 377.35 from 9 May 2017 does NOT work.

The WHQL driver 377.48 is not listed for use with the Quadro Pascal-series cards for Notebooks/laptops.
We tested the QNF 382.05 driver in a Windows 10 laptop with an NVIDIA Quadro P4000 in a Dell Precision 7720 Mobile Workstation, and it works well.
When installing a new nVidia driver for use with OpenGL stereo, select the "Custom" and "Clean" settings.
Then reset the three nVidia Control Panel settings: 120 Hz (not 144Hz), stereo enable=on, and stereo display mode="On-board DIN connector (with NVIDIA3D vision)"
or one of the top three or four selections if that isn't offered (one of them will give better stereo than the others).

If one of these two video drivers -- and we can assume drivers released after 14 June 2017 -- works, there is no need to roll back your Windows 10 Creators update.

On April 11, 2019, NVIDIA announced that support for 3D Vision in drivers would be discontinued[4], as well as support for 3DTV.
Driver releases from version 425.31 onward do not include support for 3D Vision.

"Stereoscopic 3D"
----------------------

Nvidia Control Panel -> Stereoscopic 3D -> Set up stereoscopic 3D
	In Windows 7, does not matter whether on not "Enable stereoscopic 3D" is checked (enabled) or not
	Needs to be enabled to run Nvidia test pattern (letters moving in and out of screen)


Windows10
-----------

	Settings -> Display -> 3D display mode -> On/Off
		Off gives flash when viewer starts, On give no flash
		Neither seems to fix problem of crashing
