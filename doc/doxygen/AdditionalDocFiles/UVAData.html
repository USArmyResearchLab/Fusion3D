In January 2013 I visited the University of Virginia.
In the Scholars Lab, there was interest in building 3-D terrain models for areas around Charlottesville.
In the Media lab, there was interest in terrain maps of Lhasa in Tibet.
<P>

<H3><A NAME="ps_e00">Virginia Maps</A></H3>

I was not able to find terrain maps of Charlottesville itself.
The state had made maps of an area west of Charlottesville around Waynesboro/Staunton and also around the Eastern shore.
I got a sample map of an area of Waynesboro.
<P>
The best data I could find was point-cloud data in LAZ format.
I converted the LAZ files that I got to LAS using laszip.
I then made a DEM at 1.5m resolution at about 3.7 points per pixel.
The LAS data included intensity, so I was able to make an intensity image for the DEM.
It looks pretty good, all things considered.
<P>
I also looked at a DEM they provided.
The DEM looks to be bare-earth, although I didnt find any doc on the subject.
There was also no intensity image, so the DEM looks really bad by itself.
<P>
I tried to find a good orthophoto.
I looked on the NGA WARP site, but could not find anything good.
I found a grayscale image that didnt seem to have very good res.
I also found a 4-band image, but the res is only 4-m and the bands are separate
making it even more awkward to use.
So far, it is much better to use the ladar intensity from the LAS.

I converted the LAZ files that I got to LAS using laszip.
I got a number of LAZ files, but AQ37.laz has lots of interesting features
The converted LAS file looks like this:
