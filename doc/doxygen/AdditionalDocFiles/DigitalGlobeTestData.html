The Digital Globe site EVWHS is run by Digital Globe under a contract to NGA.
It is designed to be the repository for EO imagery specifically for the US Government.
<P>
Digital Globe has 2 websites that one can login through.
Use only the EVWHS one that allows a CAC login, not the other one with no CAC (see below).
<P>



<H2><A NAME="dg-use">USING THE WEBSITE</A></H2>
<PRE>

	URL:  https://evwhs.digitalglobe.com/myDigitalGlobe/login
		The right one allows CAC login
		dont use the login site that only has password login

	Login		CAC

	Navigate:	you can enter a place name at the upper left to go directly to a spot

	AOI: 	Use book icon at right
		'Draw Rectangle option' can define an area very simply
		'Enter WKT' option allows you to specify lat-lon for AOI corners -- good for matching DEM tiles
			left-hand rule polygon (xl yh, xh yh, xh yl, xl yl, xl yh)
			Example for Kaunas Lithuania that was tested
				POLYGON(( 23.5 55.0 , 24.0 55.0 , 24.0 54.4 , 23.5 54.5 , 23.5 55.0 ))
	
	Dataset: Use advanced option
		Make sure to use 'projected' coordinate system rather than 'geographic'
		Get MrSID format

One always gets the resolution of the data -- one cant reduce resolution.
Therefore, it is very difficult to get low-res data for a very large area.

<H3><A NAME="dg-issues-names">Filename Conventions</A></H3>

Determining file types from their GRiD filenames is going to be much more difficult than it was for BuckEye.
And it may never be feasible to find an algorithm that works reliably -- doesn't get broken by the next dataset.
I have put off working on this indefinitely.
<P>
At the moment, GRiD does not have a unified filename convention.
Currently they put an indication of the security classification at the front but then just go with the convention of the contributor.
The original idea was to be able to get the original filename from the GRiD name but this doesn't seem to be working out.
<P>
NGA has been tasked with determining the filename conventions in the future.
The have not reached a conclusion and there is no documentation yet.
If and when they decide on a convention, this may not be retroactively applied to current files.
<P>
