<H1>MEASURE OR MENSURATION MENU</H1>
<HR>

This menu is used for making measurements from the map.
<B><I>The user should be careful to tilt the scene so he is looking straight down while setting points for mensuration.</I></B>
Otherwise the point selected may not be the point the user visualizes.
The middle mouse is used for measures.
Typically, measure features remain on until cleared and successive clicks will produce more measures.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">MEASURE DISTANCE</A></H2>

Use this to measure the distance between two points on the map.
When in this mode, the first click on a location with the middle mouse button will set the first endpoint of the line
and display the elevation at that point.
The second click will set the second endpoint and display the horizontal distance (dh) and the vertical distance or elevation difference (de).
A line will be drawn between the two points that can be examined in 3D by rotating and tilting the scene.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="measure_point">POINT MEASURE</A></H2>

Use this to measure the location of a point on the map with the middle mouse --
its Northing, Easting, Latitude, Longitude and elevation.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="measure_point">POINT DISTANCES ALONG A ROUTE</A></H2>

Middle-mouse clicking on two points along a route will measure the distance between the two points.
When you click, the nearest point will be determined and that point will be used for calculations.
To avoid inadvertent clicks, you must click reasonably close to a point or the click will be ignored.




<H2><A NAME="measure_point">FOR LOS MEASURE DISTANCE FROM CENTER TO ANY POINT IN THE SCENE</A></H2>

This option turns on measurements of the distance from the center of the LOS calculation to the chosen point.
The middle mouse is used to select the point and then
the LOS to that chosen point is illustrated and the distance and depression angle to that point are displayed.
<P>
The LOS calculation assumes a person viewing at its center that stands a certain height above the local terrain.
It also assumes a typical height of objects the person might see in the surrounding terrain.
These heights are defaulted to 2m and 1m, respectively, but can be adjusted by LOS parameter menu.
The measurement option draws a cube at the LOS center from the ground to that given person height.
It draws a second cube to the given object height at the chosen point.
A line is then drawn from the top of the center cube to the top of the cube at the chosen point to show the LOS. 
<P>
The length of the LOS line is printed as well as the depression (look-down) angle in degrees.
<P>




<H2><A NAME="measure_point">ADJUST HIGHLIGHTING THRESHOLDS</A></H2>

This adjusts elevation thresholds for the highlighting feature.
Highlighting vertical obstructions is useful for assessing possible landing zones
or other abrupt changes in elevation that can be dangerous or otherwise of particular interest.
Two thresholds are set here.
<P>
Distance above the terrain is calculated for a DEM pixel by taking the difference between the first-hit and last-hit
DEM elevation values for the pixel.
If the difference is above the upper threshold, then the first-hit DEM pixel is highlightes in red. 
If the difference is just above the second lower threshold, then it is highlighted in yellow.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="measure_point">CLEAR</A></H2>

This clears any mensuration functions (and any other functions that use the middle mouse).
These functions remain on until they are cleared.
<P>
