The GMTI feature is no longer available in Fusion3D.
The GMTI feature was developed to analyze obscuration and multibounce problems for GMTI sensors.
The viewer accepts GMTI data in the NATO 4607 format and was tested on the LSRS sensor.
GMTI files were loaded through the "Vector Features" menu.
<P>
Fusing GMTI data with the terrain elevation map enables calculation of areas obscured from the sensor at any time.
Since the elevation map is so accurate and has such high-resolution, a very detailed calculation of the obscuration from 
each house or tree can be made.
Such calculations can be very useful when tracking vehicles to determine when a vehicle will become obscured and
when it can be expected to emerge into the open again.
<P>
Also, the GMTI feature can be used to investigate the problem of multiple bounces where the apparent location of the target
is not the true location.
In particular, the ability to visualize the vector from any GMTI hit back to the sensor
makes it much easier to identify multibounce hits.
These hits are in areas where there should be no moving vehicles, which the terrain model helps to identify.
They also are at slightly longer ranges than they should be, which the sensor-direction vector helps to identify.

<H2><A NAME="gmti-hits">GMTI HITS FOR ANY TIME INTERVAL</A></H2>

You can display GMTI hits for any time interval desired -- the default is from the current clock time to 10 s in the past.
The length of the interval is determined by the tag "GMTI-Show-Interval" in the Parameter File.
<P>
You can run the clock to track GMTI hits as vehicles move.
The hits are shown in purple and are largest for the most current hits and get progressively smaller as the hits get older.
<P>
GMTI data files can often cover very long time intervals.
To limit the interval, one can use the tags "Data-Lims-Tmin" and "Data-Lims-Tmax" in the Parameter File.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="gmti-area">CALCULATION OF OBSCURED AREAS</A></H2>

At any location and time, you can calculate the obscuration for an area surrounding that location (see line-of-sight documentation).
This capibility is accessed through the "Line-of-Sight" menu under "Calc LOS to GMTI".
You click the desired location to the center of the screen and set the time as desired.  The LOS calculation then
shows the area that is obscured from the sensor at that particular time using the instantaneous sensor position at that time.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="gmti-vector">SENSOR-DIRECTION VECTOR FROM VEHICLE OR GMTI HIT</A></H2>

The viewer can draw a vector from two kinds of objects back towards the instantaneous location of the GMTI sensor.
Typically, the GMTI sensor is at a large standoff distance, so the vector is only drawn for a short distance in the sensor direction.
You can click (with the middle-mouse button) on any hit to see the vector to that hit.
This is useful for understanding the geometry of the hit.
<P>
If a truth track is loaded (see documentation on vector overlays),
then the vector is drawn from the position of the vehicle on the track.
This feature was designed for detailed analysis of ground-truthed tests 
where vehicles are instrumented with GPS and tracked with GMTI.
By playing the clock, one can move the vehicle along its track and at any location
visualize the line-of-sight from the sensor to the vehicle.
Where the vehicle is obscured by a building or tree, you can clearly see the vector passing through the object.
