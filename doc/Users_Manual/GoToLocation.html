Under the 'Locations' menu, open the 'Jump to Location/Read Location' window.
Enter coordinates in the window in any of the 3 coordinate systems and hit the corresponding "Move to Loc" button.
The display will center on the chosen location.
You can choose UTM, MGRS or Latitude-Longitude coordinates.
The window also shows the location of the center of the scene.
Whenever you left-click a map location to screen center, the coordinates of that point are displayed in that window.
<P>
A move to a new location may take time, so please be patient.
If you make a mistake or enter a location off the map, then the viewer will render the scene as blank.
You can recover by entering a valid location or hitting the RESET button.

This option allows you to define a bookmark at a point on the map by middle-mouse clicking on the point.
An text window will allow you to associate a name with the bookmark.
Clicking with CNTRL-middle mouse near a bookmark will delete that bookmark.
To help avoid inadvertent clicks, one must click within 300m of the point to delete it.
<P>
Buttons will be added to the left of the main window for the first 4 bookmarks that you define.
Clicking on one of these buttons will center the display on that bookmark.
It is a handy way to quickly move around to interesting areas in a large scene.

<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">OPEN BOOKMARKS FILE/SAVE BOOKMARKS FILE</A></H2>

Bookmarks can be saved to a KML file and KML bookmark files can be imported.
Bookmark files are just simple KML files that define a series of points with text associated with each point.
They can be edited or created with another program.
