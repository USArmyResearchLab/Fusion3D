<HR>

A complete definition of all the valid Project File tags is given <A HREF="./TaggedAscii.html">here</A>
This section describes the format for the Project File and discusses some of the most important tags.
<P>
The Project File is ASCII and can be edited with any text editor like Wordpad.
It consists of a number of tags with their associated parameters.
A tag must be a single word with no spaces, is case sensitive and must be at the beginning of a line.
Anything else is ignored and interpreted as a comment, although comments begin with "# " by convention.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">Tags that Define the Map</A></H2>

The most important tags are the ones that define maps.
There are currently either 3 or 4 such tags that define each map.
<P>
The first tag is the reference location or map origin that initializes the viewer centered at the location defined.
You want to specify a point approximately at the center of the area of current
interest to minimize the movement necessary to get to desired locations.
The tag has the following definition:
<PRE>

	Ref-LL-Deg	latitude longitude
		latitude  = latitude of reference point in deg
		longitude = longitude of reference point in deg (West uses negative values)

</PRE>
Note that the values are decimal degrees, not degrees-minutes-seconds as is sometimes used.
<P>
The second tag defines the location and naming conventions for the map.
The tag has the following definition:
<PRE>

	Map3d-Index-Find   locName dir  prefix  suffix texture exclude
		locName	A map name just used for documentation
		dir     	Directory -- all relevent files in this directory and all its subdirectories will be loaded
		prefix     Prefix of primary last-hit elevation file (will try to use all files with names fitting the pattern "prefix*suffix")
					Choose the prefix/suffix only for the last-hit elevation -- names for the other file types will be derived.
					The prefix can be the pattern for the entire name in which case the suffix will be ignored.
		suffix     Suffix of primary last-hit elevation file
		texture     Type of map data used to texture the surface 
					"int" -- use grayscale intensity (typically from the ladar backscatter intensity)
					"mrg" -- use color imagery (satellite or false color)
		exclude     No. of pixels to exclude at edges of each tile
					Buckeye tiles overlap and pixels at the edges may be corrupted, so set = 2
					Other data sets:  set = 0



</PRE>
The prefix and suffix should be defined so as to include all desired files and no undesired ones.
(Note:  the relevent logic is in method dir_class::read_dir_indexed.)
<P>
The third tag is used when MrSID files are to be used to texture the DEM map.
<PRE>

	Map3d-Index-MrSID   locName pattern index  
		locName     A map name just used for documentation
		pattern     Unique pattern to search for MrSID files in the directory (eg *.sid)   
		index       Not used -- just for backward compatibility


</PRE>
All files matching the search pattern will be loaded from the directory specified in tag 'Map3d-Index-Find'.
<P>
The fourth tag is used when files are defined explicitly rather than loading all files matching search patterns.
<PRE>

	Map3d-Index-Files
		-A2    <name> <name> ...
		-A1    <name> <name> ...
		-TEX    <name> <name> ...
		-KML    <name> <name> ...
		-END


</PRE>






<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">Tags for Map Size</A></H2>

Another important parameter tag controls the size of the map:
<PRE>

	Tiles-N         48 36 4 1 	# Typical map sizes


</PRE>
The first two parameters are the halfwidth in low-resolution tiles of the map display in x and y.
Thus, the display will be 2*48+1=97 tiles wide and 73 tiles high.
By default, tiles are 128-by-128 pixels in size.
The third parameter is the halfwidth in tiles of the medium-resolution portion of the map.
Thus, a 9x9 tile area at the center of the map will be in medium resolution.
The last parameter is is the halfwidth in tiles of the high-resolution portion of the map.
Thus, a 3x3 tile area at the center of the map will be in high resolution.
