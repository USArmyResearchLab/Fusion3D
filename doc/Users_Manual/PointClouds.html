<H1>POINT-CLOUD MENU</H1>
<HR>

You can load point-cloud data in LAS or BPF formats from the 'File' menu and fuse that data with the DEMs and orthophotos.
The visualization approach used for Fusion3D makes the combination of DEM and point cloud much easier and more natural than other viewers.
<P>
The point-cloud overlay feature was designed for overlays of very high detail for small areas.
The DEM/orthophoto map provides coverage of the large area and the lidar overlay provides even more details for a area of particular interest.
One example would be ground-based, mobile-mapping lidar files of a building or block streetscape.
Another would be the overhead lidar point cloud for a small area that could be examined for detail that might not have been captured in the DEM.
The viewer option works for lidar for larger areas, but is not designed for this application and probably will not work as well as other viewers.
<P>
Lidar overlays can be toggled on and off with the 'Pnts' button on the left of the main window.
The DEM map can also be toggled on and off with the 'Map' button.
Using these buttons, you can see either the DEM or the point cloud or both together.
<P>




<H2><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>DISPLAY PARAMETERS</H2>

<H3><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>Color Balance</H3>

By default, colors for point-cloud points are displayed as specified in the data.
However, some colorized clouds have had a very strong tint and an attempt was made to balance the colors.
There is an option to histogram-equalize each color independently that markedly improved some clouds.
<P>



<H3><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>False Color Scale</H3>

For clouds that are not colorized, a false color scheme based on elevation is used to help render the cloud.
The defaut is a relatively natural scale of hues that goes from green to white as elevation increases.
Alternatively a blue-to-red color scheme can be used.
<P>
The default is to base colors on absolute elevation.
However, for sloping terrain, elevation relative to the local average may be much more useful.
In this case, basing colors on absolute elevation shows only the slope, resulting in one side of the map being all red and the other side being all blue.
In most situations, however, color is better used to show local features such as trees, buildings and other manmade objects, which using relative elevation
does much more effectively.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>FILTERS</H2>

<H3><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>Filter on Elevation</H3>

This allows the user to process and display only cloud points within the specified elevation bounds.
It can be useful, for example, for complex forested scenes where points higher in the trees may obscure more interesting features near the ground.
<P>



<H3><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>Filter on Elevation Above DEM</H3>

This allows the user to process and display only point-cloud points within specified elevation bounds relative to the local ground elevation.
This is similar to filtering on elevation, but is more useful is areas where there is a lot of elevation change.
Simply filtering on absolute elevation may give meaningful results in only a small region but may be useless for areas further up or down a hill.
<P>



<H3><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>Filter on FINE Algorithm Quality Metric TAU</H3>

This filter was implemented for a specific algorithm, the FINE algorithm developed by a group for NGA, that calculates a quality metric for each point in the cloud.
It can easily be extended to any algorithm that derives a quality metric.
The quality metric is particularly useful for Geiger-mode lidars which are very noisy.
One can filter out virtually all the noise but at the expense of losing some faint features (as you would need to do to grid the cloud into a DSM).
Alternatively, one can take advantage of people's pattern recognition skills to see relatively faint features through large amounts of noise.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>FINE Algorithm Threshold Slider</H3>

With this slider one can interactively adjust the threshold on the quality metric to only show points with quality above the threshold.
Again, this is specific to the FINE algorithm but can be extended to any quality metric.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="chum_intro_lidar"></A>GRIDDING -- MAKING A DSM FROM THE POINT CLOUDS</H2>

This feature makes use a utility code 'gridder' that can create a DSM from the point cloud file(s).
The 'gridder' code may not be supplied with the Fusion3D distribution,
but if it is it can provide a quick way to grid a point cloud.
<P>
The method used was developed at ARL to produce both a first-hit and last-hit DSM similar to the BuckEye maps.
We believe it produces significantly better maps than other codes.
Here it is meant to be a quick way and easy to generate a DSM to complement a point cloud being displayed.
However, the gridder utility can be used directly or there are many other codes that can be used for this purpose.
<P>
