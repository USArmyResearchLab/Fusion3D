Three types of Line-Of-Sight (LOS) algorithms have been implemented:
The first type is from a central point on the ground to all ground points around it.
This can be used in the case where an event happens at a particular location and you want
to find all locations in the surrounding area from which a person could see that event.
It can also be used for the inverse problem, visualizing which areas can be seen from a given vantage point.
<P>
The second type is LOS from a stationary standoff sensor to all points in a given area.
This is used to determine which pixels are visible to a sensor and which points are obscured by nearby terrain features.
<P>
The third is for sun shadowing.
One can set the day of the year and the time of day and then see the sun shadows as they would appear
on that day at that time at that location on the earth.
It was originally coded to help register wide-area motion imagery (WAMI) against orthophotos where sun shadows
are a very important feature of the WAMI imagery.
<P>
A fourth type was implemented but is no longer available in the current Fusion3D implementation.
It is LOS for a moving sensor and is implemented specifically for a GMTI sensor to all points in a given area.
This is used to determine which pixels are visible to the GMTI sensor and which points are obscured by nearby terrain features.

The first LOS submenu "Calc LOS ground-to-ground" allows you to show the results of the calculation, and
you can repeat this operation as many times as you wish.
The submenu "Clear LOS" allows you to 
clear the results of the last calculation when you no longer need them.
The submenu "Save LOS to shapefile" allows you to save the LOS region outlines as polygons in Shapefile format.
The submenu "Change LOS parameters" allows you to change important paramaters and will probably be necessary
for a realistic calculation.
<P>
After the calculation is completed (which may take some time for large areas)
all locations shadowed from the central point are darkened and tinted with a redish shade.
A light green marker is put at the center.
<P>
Calculations are done to the focal point at the center of the screen, so you should first click on
the desired point to bring it to the screen center.
All calculations are done for DEMs only and dont include point clouds.
<P>



<H3>Algorithm Parameters</H3>

The LOS Parameter submenu sets a number of parameters for this calculation.
Calculations are done from a minimum radius to a maximum radius, both of which are adjustable from that submenu.
It is assumed that the object at the center (say an incident) is a certain height above the ground.
This height can be adjusted with the "Height at center loc" parameter.
Likewise, it is assumed that someone somewhere in the surrounding area is at another height above the ground. 
This second height can be adjusted with the "Height at perimeter loc" parameter.
<P>
For example, if an event happens in the street and you want to find out where a spotter might have been,
you might pick a center height of 1m above the street.
You might assume that a spotter would be standing somewhere in the surrounding area,
so the height of his eyes at the perimeter locations would be be about 1.8m.
You might also assume that the spotter would be somewhere within a 200-m radius, so you would set the 
max radius to be 200m.
You want this radius to be a small as possible to reduce compute times.
<P>
The minimum radius parameter has two main uses.
The first is for the case such as calculating what a man standing on a roof can see.
The LOS calculations are done to a single point and
from any single point on the roof, the rest of the roof will obscure most of the scene.
But you really want to know what the man can see from any nearby point on the roof where he might move
to get a better view.
By setting the minimum radius so as to exclude obscuration from the roof itself,
you can get a very good approximation of this more general case.
<P>
The minimum radius is also meant to exclude small objects very near the center that
could cause shadows but are not valid.
For instance, if a car happened to be nearby an incident in the 3-D terrain map, 
it might might throw a large shadow into the surrounding area.
But since that car would probably not be there at the time of the event, you would want set the minimum
radius large enough to exclude it from the calculations.
<P>



<H3>Algorithm Description</H3>

To do the calculation, rays are cast from the point above the center location to the a point
above the center of each pixel.
If a ray passes below the level of the 3-D terrain map at any point, then the corresponding point is marked as shadowed.
The calculations are standard, but are limited by several factors.
First, they are point calculations and ones done at slightly different locations will have somewhat different results.
Second, they may show shadowing from objects that only partially shadow or don't shadow at all.
Trees are a good example of sparse objects that will throw shadows in the viewer but which one may be able to see through.
Another example is bridges, where one may be able to see under a bridge but the viewer would show the view as completely blocked.
So one should keep in mind these fundamental limitations.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="los-to-sensor">OPTION 2:  LINE-OF-SIGHT TO A STANDOFF SENSOR AT A FIXED LOCATION</A></H2>

This type of LOS calculation is used to determine the areas that are obscured from the view of a fixed-position standoff sensor.
The location of the fixed sensor is entered from the LOS-Parameters menu or with the tag "LOS-Sensor-RLOC" in the Parameter File.
The sensor location is defined as offset distances in meters North and East relative to the screen center.
<P>
The second submenu "Calc LOS (fixed-position standoff sensor)" allows you to show the results of the sensor shadowing, and
you can repeat this operation as many times as you wish.
The submenu "Clear LOS" allows you to 
clear the results of the last calculation when you no longer need them.
The submenu "Save LOS to shapefile" allows you to save the LOS region outlines as polygons in Shapefile format.
<P>
After the calculation is completed,
all locations shadowed from the sensor are darkened and tinted with a bluish shade.
<P>
An important limitation of the algorithm is that it assumes that the distance to the sensor is large enough that the angles to the different points in the 
calculation square can be approximated by the angles to its center.
Therefore, the feature should only be used for sensors at a reasonably large distance or, if the sensor is closer, for small areas on the ground.
<P>


<H3>Algorithm Description</H3>

The algorithm works by tracing a ray from each pixel in the scene back toward the sensor
and testing whether it intersects some other part of the terrain map.
For sensors close to the horizon, there can be severe implementation problems,
since potentially unbounded regions of terrain must be tested.
Since testing for the required regions of terrain is very expensive and may extend beyond the dataset as well,
the algorithm puts reasonable limits on the area of terrain to be tested.
Therefore, it should be used with care for sensors very close to the horizon
or in regions where there are very high buildings or large elevation differences that could shadow far from the 
test region and not be captured by the LOS calculation.
<P>



<H3>Algorithm Parameters</H3>

The algorithm has 5 parameters that can be adjusted.
The calculation is done for a square area centered at the screen center.
The first parameter is the length L of that square (so the square is of size LxL).
The next two parameters are the azimuth and elevation of the sensor.
It is assumed that the distance to the sensor is large enough that the angles to the different points in the 
calculation square can be approximated by the angles to its center.
<P>
The fourth parameter is a height above the ground for each pixel --
the algorithm actually calculates the shadowing for points slightly above given map elevations.
This makes the result cleaner and less noisy, avoiding shadows from minor elevation differences in the map.
It is also more realistic for radars, since most radar scatterers are typically above ground level.
<P>
The last parameter determines how far the algorithm traces rays.
At each pixel, the algorithm follows the ray until it reaches a specified height above the original pixel elevation.
This height difference is also used to determine how much additional area of the terrain map is read in for testing.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="los-to-sun">OPTION 3:  LINE-OF-SIGHT TO THE SUN -- USED FOR SHADOW CALCULATIONS</A></H2>

LOS calculations for sun shadowing were originally designed for WAMI image registration and this option was added
to help verify the algorithms and to aid in visualizing details of the sun shadows.
However, by using the LOS Parameter Menu to specify a date and time, sun shadows can be calculated for any location and time.
<P>
The fourth submenu "Calculate Sun Shadowing" allows you to show the results of the sun shadowing, and
you can repeat this operation for as many areas as you wish.
The submenu "Clear Line-of-Sight" allows you to clear the results of the last calculation when you no longer need them.
The submenu "Save Line-of-Sight" allows you to save the LOS region mask and outlines.
<P>
After the calculation is completed,
all locations shadowed from the sensor are darkened and tinted with a bluish shade.
<P>


<H3>Algorithm Description</H3>

The algorithm works by tracing a ray from each pixel in the scene back toward the sun
and testing whether it intersects some other part of the terrain map.
For the sun close to the horizon, there can be severe implementation problems,
since potentially unbounded regions of terrain must be tested.
Since testing for the required regions of terrain is very expensive and may extend beyond the dataset as well,
the algorithm puts reasonable limits on the area of terrain to be tested.
Therefore, it should be used with care for sensors very close to the horizon
or in regions where there are very high buildings or large elevation differences that could shadow far from the 
test region and not be captured by the LOS calculation.
<P>



<H3>Algorithm Parameters</H3>

The algorithm has 5 parameters that can be adjusted.
The calculation is done for a square area centered at the screen center.
The first parameter is the length L of that square (so the square is of size LxL).
The next two parameters are the azimuth and elevation of the sun.
The distance to the sun is large enough and the calculation patch is small enough
so that the angles to the different points in the 
calculation square can be approximated by the angles to its center.
<P>
The fourth parameter is a height above the ground for each pixel --
the algorithm actually calculates the shadowing for points slightly above given map elevations.

It is also more realistic for radars, since most radar scatterers are typically above ground level.
<P>
The last parameter determines how far the algorithm traces rays.
At each pixel, the algorithm follows the ray until it reaches a specified height above the original pixel elevation.
This height difference is also used to determine how much additional area of the terrain map is read in for testing.
<P>

<H2><A NAME="los-output">OUTPUT OF LOS TO FILES</A></H2>

Shadowed areas from any of the calculations above can be written to both a shapefile and a GeoTIFF file.
The TIFF file covers the area of the shadow calculation and is binary-valued.
It shows a value of 255 for pixels that are shadowed and 0 for pixels that are not.
<P>
The shapefile is a list of polygons describing the boundaries of the various shadow and non-shadow regions.
Note that this may be very complicated with nested regions.
For instance, a shadow region may lie within a non-shadow region which, in turn, may lie within a shadow region.
The attributes for the shapefile are as follows:
<PRE>

	ShdFlag	Shadow Flag 0=non-shadowed (visible), 1=shadowed, per polygon
	CntrLat	Latitude  of center of calculated area -- same for all entries
	CntrLon	Longitude of center of calculated area -- same for all entries
	CntrHgt	Height at center location -- same for all entries
	PerifHgt	Height at peripheral locations -- same for all entries

</PRE>
The last 2 attributes are meaningful for the case of LOS to a center location, but not meaningful
for sensor obscuration or sun shadows.
<P>
There are 3 parameters in the LOS parameter menu that determine what information is written to the shapefile.
There are 2 switches that toggle on and off the outlines of the visible and shadow regions, respectively.
The default is for both types of outline to be on.
The third parameter determines whether to include shadow regions that touch the outer border of the calculations.
This parameter is defaulted on and needs to be on for the sun shadow and sensor obscuration cases.
Otherwise, important shadow areas would be lost.
For the LOS to screen center, the result sometimes looks clearer if boundary shadow regions are omitted.
You may want to try 2 sets of outputs, one with and one without, and pick the better one.
<P>



<H3>Algorithm Description</H3>

The algorithm first processes visible regions, then shadowed ones.
For each type of region, it scans through the image looking for the first pixel of the correct type; this then becomes a seed pixel.
For each seed pixel, it finds the region surrounding that seed.
Contiguous regions are defined by 4-neighbors (those pixels touching top-to-bottom or side-to-side, but not diagonally).
It marks every pixel in the region with a unique region id in the mask, so the region will be excluded from further calculations.
<P>
Once it has found a region and marked it, it traverses the boundary of the region.
It lays lines, each the width of a pixel as it goes until it reaches the starting location.
The lines for each region then define a single polygon for writing to the shapefile.
<P>
