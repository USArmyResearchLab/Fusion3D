<H1>THE DRAW MENU</H1>
<HR>


Using the "Draw" menu, one can define points with associated text or icons, lines, circles, and polygons.
One can then write these features into a KML file or read previously-made vector files.
For points, one can choose either to render the point directly as a point on the screen or to show text or an icon at the point, or both.
Lines can be rendered either as solid or dashed.
Polygons are rendered in wireframe only.
<P>
Features can be edited using the buttons at the left of the main window.
Individual points within lines or polygons can be moved or deleted.
Also, entire features can be moved or deleted.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="draw-mouat">CREATING AND USING MILITARY SYMBOLS</A></H2>

There are 2 basically similar standards for military icons -- 2525B/C which is for the US and NATO APP6B.
They are heirarchical and can define procedurally a large number of different icons based on different attributes.
They span the entire universe of military things, so they tend to be pretty broad categories.
<P>
We have not been able to find a c++ library that creates icons and also this would require a lot of programming to
make a rather complex menu to construct the icons.
So we create icons external to Fusion3D and use the images in the code.
<P>
We have used the open-source code Microdem to generate the military symbols.
It uses basic symbols from MAPSYMBS.COM in the form of 'fonts' so these fonts have to be loaded also or all the useful symbols dont appear.
You access the icon composer by running Microdem, clicking the 'file' menu, the 'tools' submenu and the 'Military icon generator'.
You should see 5 tabs, starting with the 'FR land'.  If you only see 2 starting with 'DRMS' then the MAPSYMBS.COM symbols have not been recognized.
You can save files as BMP, JPEG, GIF, and PNG.
<p>
Fusion3D looks for military symbols in a subdirectory of its bin directory: bin/milSymbols.
It requires a BMP image file for each symbol.
One should specify a standard size in Microdem when saving symbols, but the symbols are typically different sizes,
most larger than the specified size.
<P>
Fusion3D has a menu that shows all the military symbols in directory bin/milSymbols.
One can choosed the desired symbol from this menu.
The menu can accomodata over 100 symbols, but is fixed size.  If there are too many symbols, some symbols may not appear.

<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">INITIATE DRAW</A></H2>

This initiates the draw process enabling draw features to be digitized.
It adds buttons to the left of the main window to control the digitizing process.
(Draw can also be initialized by reading a file to edit or append.)
<P>
To start digitizing, use the 'New Feature' button.
Features are digitized using the middle mouse button.
The current feature will be drawn as red and other features will be in blue.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="chum_intro">Draw Buttons</A></H3>

One group of added buttons controls features.
A line, polygon or circle or a point with associated icon or text is considered a feature.
The 'New Feature' button controls the type of the feature and its parameters.
An entire feature can be moved or deleted with these buttons.
At any time the current feature can be changed by hitting the 'Select Feature' button and then middle-mouse
clicking as near as possible to a point in the desired feature.
Digitizing new points is always done by adding to the current feature.
<P>
Another group of buttons controls individual points within the current feature.
Individual points can be moved or deleted.
Points can also be added to the feature, but only at the end of the feature.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">READ FILE</A></H2>

This reads in a new file that is appended to the draw current features.
It can then be edited as any other draw features as described above.
If draw digitizing has not already been initialized, reading in a file will do that initialization.
<P>
Vector files in a number of formats can be read including KML, KMZ, Shapefile, OSM, and some ASCII text files
(see documentation on vector overlays).


<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">SAVE</A></H2>

Files can be saved to the KML format.

<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">ADD ALTITUDE</A></H2>

By default, draw features are defined at the local map elevations.
If desired, the altitude of the current feature (only) can be modified with this submenu.
The altitude can be defined as absolute or relative to the ground.
<p>
By default, altitudes are written into KML as absolute values using the value of the terrain at the point.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">CLEAR</A></H2>

This clears all the current draw objects.
If the information has not been previously saved, it will be lost.
<P>
