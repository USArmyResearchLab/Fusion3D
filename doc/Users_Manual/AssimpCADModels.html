<H1>CAD MENU -- IMPORTING CAD MODELS IN ASSIMP IMPORTABLE FORMATS</H1>
<HR>


Fusion3D uses the Assimp library to import CAD models to superimpose on the map.
This feature is very new and has only been tested in a few cases, so it should be considered experimental.
Note that the Shapefile format allows for very simple CAD models, but this format is not handled from this menu.
It is handled from the 'Vector Overlays' menu.
<P>
The Assimp library is a C++ implementation for importing CAD models in many popular formats.
In particular, it supports Collada (.dae) and Wavefront Object (.obj).
There is a list of about 30 other supported formats so it is very general.
Other advantages are that it is self-contained and does not require loading lots of other libraries
and that it puts data into a structure that is very similar to OpenGL so it does not require
lots of additional transformations to use it.

CAD models are typically defined in a local coordinate system with its origin somewhere within the model.
So the 'Open' submenu provides a Northing, Easting and elevation in map coordinates to place the CAD model origin
within the map.
There are also provisions to rotate and scale the model as well.
