<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">SAVING AND LOADING PROJECTS</A></H2>

The 'Save Project' menu entry allows you to save the current map, any associated vector overlays, and many map parameters to a file.
The saved file can be loaded later to retrive the map.
<P>
By convention, the project file suffix is '.s4d'.
The file is ASCII and can be modified using any standard editor.
It uses tags with parameters and the tags are defined in this documentation.
This is for advanced users, but allows access to some less-used parameters not available from the menus
and can also be very helpful in shortcutting map setup, particularly for demos.
More information on project files can be found <A HREF="./ParameterFiles.html">here</A>

<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">LOADING DEM MAPS</A></H2>

The base data layer for the viewer is the Digital Surface Model (DSM) or Digital Elevation Model (DEM) rasterized map.
The viewer provides two options for loading DEMs.
The first is an expedited menu for loading particular DEMs that follow strict naming conventions.
The second is more general but requires more effort.
<P>


<H3><A NAME="chum_intro">Loading Maps From BuckEye, HALOE and ALIRT</A></H3>

Special expedited loading is provided for DSM/DEM data from the the BuckEye, HALOE and ALIRT programs.
These programs follow strict naming conventions and this feature can be exploited to load all files from a given
directory in a single step.
This includes the DSM/DEM data and also EO texture files and KML files defining tile extents.
<P>
For BuckEye, the primary DEM file is the 'a2' or last-hit DEM.  The viewer will automatically load the corresponding 'a1' first-hit
DEM and the 'mrg' false-color texture file.
If the 'mrg' file is not available, it will try to load the 'int' lidar intensity file.
Also, it will load any very-high resolution orthophoto files in the MrSID format that are in the directory.
These orthophotos are produced by another BuckEye sensor and are available for most of the areas covered by the BuckEye lidar
as well as some areas covered by HALOE and ALIRT.
Although they are accessed from a different part of the website, the orthophoto extents are usually coordinated with the lidar 
making them very handy to use.
Fusion with the orthophotos greatly improves the utility of the DEMs and you should use them whenever possible.
<P>
For HALOE, the primary DEM is usually the 'EGM96_DSM' file or, alternatively, the 'WGS84_DSM' file.
The viewer will automatically load the 'INT' intensity texture file and, as described above, any MrSID orthophotos in the directory.
<P>
For ALIRT, the primary DEM file is the 'DSM' file.
The viewer will automatically load all the 'RII' intensity texture files and, as described above, any MrSID orthophotos in the directory.
<P>
The menu entry allows you to load groups of tiles in a single step.
For instance, you can load all 64 tiles of the BuckEye Baghdad map in one step, allowing easy access to very large maps.
The menu will tell you how many files of each type it finds.
<P>




<H3><A NAME="chum_intro">Loading Maps From Other Sources</A></H3>

The Fusion3D viewer works with commercial DEM data and other programs that do not follow naming conventions.
When files do not follow the naming conventions for the BuckEye, HALOE and ALIRT programs, use the 'Load DEM -- Other' menu entry.
This allows you to choose the files individually and to specify which files you want to load.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">LOADING LIDAR POINT CLOUDS</A></H2>

The 'Load LAS or BPF Point Cloud' menu entry allows you to load point clouds in either the 'LAS' format or the 'BPF' format.
The LAS format is the most commonly used format for ladar point clouds and many open-source codes can convert other formats to LAS.
The Binary Point File (BPF) format was developed by Johns Hopkins APL and is typically used for Geiger Mode ladar outputs.
This feature is designed primarily for very-high resolution imaging (either from the ground or from the air) for a small area.
It can also be used for larger terrain maps, but the viewer is not designed for this purpose and is not as efficient as other viewers.
<P>




<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">CLEAR ALL</A></H2>

The viewer can process only a single map  -- either a single tile or group of tiles loaded in the same single step.
To access another map, you must first clear the viewer using the 'Clear all Models' menu entry.
<P>




<H2><A NAME="chum_intro">RENDERING THE SCREEN TO A FILE OR FILES</A></H2>

The 'Save Screen to JPEG' menu entry allows you to render all objects in the scene to a file.
The viewer does a separate rendering into the file rather than simply copy the screen.
So the size and aspect ratio of the file are independent of the window size on the screen
<P>
The first menu option is to write to a single file that the user specifies.
The second menu option is to write to a sequence of files in the current directory. 
Using the defaults, images get saved with filename 'temp.nnnn.jpg', where nnnn is a sequence number.
In this way you can save a sequence of images with the sequence number embedded in them, starting with 1.
This option is meant to be used to save a sequence that can be converted to an animated sequence or a movie.
<P>
The default output image size is 640 in width by 512 in height.
The default file-name base and the output image size can be modified in the Parameter file.
<P>
