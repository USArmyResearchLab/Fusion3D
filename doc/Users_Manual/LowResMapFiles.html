DEM maps are constructed as a sequence of small tiles, typically 128x128 pixels.
High-resolution tiles are made immediately around the focus point,
Then medium-resolution tiles are made in an anulus around this high-resolution area.
Finally, in the background, low-resolution tiles are made for the surrounding area to provide context for the display.
In many cases, orthophotos are available at significantly higher resolution than the DEM and in these cases
high-resolution tiles are made that utilize the full resolution of both the DEM and the orthophoto texture.
Medium-resolution tiles use texture at the same resolution as the DEM -- 
even in the case where orthophotos are not available, grayscale texture is usually available from the lidar data itself.
Low-resolution tiles use only the 4 corners of each tile for elevations and a heavily subsampled version of the texture.
These are intended for context only.
<P>
In order to visualize arbitrarily large maps and to save time on first opening the viewer,
maps are constructed only in the vicinity of the focus point.
As the user moves around on the map, old tiles are discarded and new tiles are constructed on the fly around the new focus point.
<P>
When a DEM map is first accessed from a given directory, a low-resolution elevation map is constructed for the entire map area.
Where the map is large, the low-res map is saved into a file
and whenever that map is accessed again the row-res elevations are read from that file.
The low-res elevation map contains the estimated elevations at each corner of the 128x128 tiles.
There is some data processing involved in estimating elevations,
which only takes a few seconds for a small map, but can take several minutes for a very large map area.
<P>
It is also possible to precompute a texture map downsampled to the desired resolution of the low-res tiles.
When that is saved to a file, the viewer will use this data to significantly speed up creation of low-res tiles.
This is not done automatically, however, as it involves using a separate utility code that is not included in the general distribution.
Also, there are tradeoffs in setting the resolution of the texture map.
This map must be maintained in Fusion3D memory, and higher-resolution mosaics also use more resources when visualized.
So the resolution must be set carefully.
<P>
The offline mosaicing process is described in the section below.

<H2><A NAME="lowres-elev">LOW-RES ELEVATION FILE</A></H2>

<P>
Whenever the map is large, the low-resolution elevations for the entire area are saved to a file and
then read from that file thereafter.
An arbitrary size threshold was set; whenever the map contains multiple tiles or there would be more that 6000
low-res elevation points, then the data would be saved.
For smaller maps (the size of one typical BuckEye tile or smaller) the processing time is minimal and it is not 
worth saving the file.
For larger maps, however, processing time becomes annoying and then the shortcut file is used.
<P>
When a map is accessed, the viewer looks for the low-res elevation file and uses it if available.
This file follows the following naming convention;
<PRE>

	When all files are loaded from a given directory, say

		D:\Belgium

	then the low-res elevation file is

		C:\Belgium\Belgium_lowres_elev.dat

	When the files are loaded individually, then the directory of the DEM will be used.

</PRE>





<H2><A NAME="lowres-tex">LOW-RES TEXTURE FILE</A></H2>

As originally written, low-res tiles are constructed within the viewer in the same fashion as the other tiles.
They are made one-by-one in concentric circles around the focus point.
For each tile (typically 128x128), the corresponding texture file (or files) is opened and at least a portion of that file is read.
The texture is then clipped to the tile dimensions and then downsampled.
All this multiple opening and closing, clipping and subsampling is very inefficient.
The tradeoff for simple and elegant implementation was reasonable for the small maps that were the norm at the time
the code was developed.
However, since then maps have grown in size and now province-sized maps are sometimes desired.
For the largest size low-res area that the viewer can visualize, the time to construct the low-res tiles can be
as much as an hour.
Even though this happens in the background and does not disrupt interactive commands, the delay is clearly not tolerable.
<P>
Where delays in constructing the low-res tiles for context are significant, a low-res texture file can be created.
This file is written offline with a utility code, is read once on initializing the viewer, is stored and used to
create any low-res tiles thereafter.
This gives dramatically faster performance, creating a large surround in orders of magnitude less time.

<H3>Using the Low-Res Texture Mosaic</H3>


If the output mosaic is placed in the proper directory and given the proper name, then it will automatically be read and used by 
the Fusion3D viewer.
The convention is as follows:


<PRE>

	Fusion3D looks for a low-res texture mosaic in the base directory that was searched for DEM-associated files
	(the one specified in the File->Load DEM menu and subsequently written to the Project file under the 'Map3d-Index-Find' tag)
	It does not search subdirectories since these can also have mosaics for subsets of the map.

	It looks for the file with the name ending with '_lowres_texture.tif'

	For example, in the directory

		D:/wosan

	The low-res elevation file is

		D:/wosan/wosan_lowres_elev.dat

	then the following low-res texture file would be found 

		D:/wosan/wosan_res16m_lowres_texture.tif

	Note that the first part of the name is available for encoding additional info such as the map name and 16-m resolution


</PRE>








<H3>Mosaicr Utility Program</H3>

A utility code 'mosaicr' that generates a single texture mosaic for a large area using smaller higher-resolution subimages
was written at the Army Research Lab.
The user has the option of either entering from a chosen directory all the files matching a certain pattern, or
he can enter groups of files by selecting them from a browser window.
<P>
Before it starts the processing, the code will show the size of the output mosaic.
Keep in mind that the file must be kept in memory in Fusion3D and may be slow to render if made too large. 
<P>
The mosaicr code is not implemented for all types of texture files and implemented only for color (3-byte) input imagery.
It reads MrSID and GeoTiff input files and produces a GeoTiff output file.
We cannot write MrSID files since we do not have a license to write MrSID (only to read these files).
Since Fusion3D reads the resulting output file only once at full resolution, there is not a significant advantage of MrSID
over GeoTiff anyway.
The code moves file-by-file, summing each input pixel from that file into the appropriate (downsampled) mosaic pixel.
Thus every output pixel is the average of all the input pixels that overlap it.
<P>
