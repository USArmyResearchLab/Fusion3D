<DL>
	<DT>File
	<DD>Load raster maps and lidar point clouds.  Save currently loaded files and settings to a file which can be loaded later
	to restore the current view.  Also, write the current screen view to a file.
	<P>
	<DT>Point Cloud
	<DD>Adjust parameters for Lidar point clouds or apply a filter so that you can display a selected subset of the point cloud.
	<P>
	<DT>Vector Overlays
	<DD>Load vector overlays, toggle individual vector overlays on and off and digitize vector features.
	You can digitize and save a single-line vector,
	useful for outlining major features like highways or waterways to help orient yourself on the map.
	<P>
	<DT>Draw
	<DD>This feature is designed to allow the user to annotate the map with general-purpose vector features.
	It includes point features with associated text or icons.
	Circles can be generated by clicking on the center and dragging to any location on the desired circle.
	<P>
	<DT>Locations
	<DD>Read out the location of the center of the screen or jump to a specified location.
	Also, you can define, save and retrieve bookmarks from this menu.
	<P>
	<DT>Line-of-Sight
	<DD>Line-of-sight can be calculated to and from a point on the ground.
	Also, line-of-sight to a stationary or moving standoff sensor platform can be calculated.
	Finally, sun shadows can be calculated given a date and time of day.
	Outlines and masks of shadow regions can be saved to a file.
	<P>
	<DT>Measure
	<DD>Allows measurement of distances, both horizontal and vertical, between two points.
	Also, you can show the location information for a single picked point.
	<P>
	<DT>Stereo
	<DD>Turns on and off stereo and adjust stereo offsets.
	Both anaglyph (red-blue) stereo and Nvidia active shutter glasses stereo are available.
	<P>
	<DT>Clock
	<DD>Some data like MTI has times associated with it and the clock can be used to scan the data in time.
	Also, vehicle tracks like the vehicle used to take mobile-mapping lidar data have time associated with them.
	<P>
	<DT>Defaults
	<DD>Adjust the size of different map regions to best match the speed and memory available on your graphics card.
	Also, you can adjust the default stereo setting.
	<P>
	<DT>CAD
	<DD>This is a very new feature that has not been thoroughly tested and should be considered experimental.
	It uses the Assimp library to superimpose CAD models onto the scene
	<P>
	<DT>Help
	<DD>Access basic information about the viewer or the users manual.
