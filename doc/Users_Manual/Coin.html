<H1>COIN3D IMPLEMENTATION OF THE OPENINVENTOR GRAPHICS LIBRARY</H1>
<HR>

The Fusion3D viewer uses the Coin3D library which is an implementation of the OpenInventor graphics library API.
<P>
The following is from the Wikipedia entry on Coin3D:

From 1998 to 2011 Coin3D was developed and maintained by Systems in Motion (SIM), later renamed to Kongsberg SIM, later merged into the parent company Kongsberg Oil & Gas Technologies Kongsberg Gruppen. During this period Coin3D was available under a dual license scheme: GPL or a proprietary commercial license. Mid-2011, Kongsberg decided to end Coin3D as a commercial product due to diminishing demand and changing business focus. As a service to the user community Kongsberg re-licensed Coin3D under the less restrictive BSD 3-clause license. Since then, the BSD licensed source code has been maintained by its users and is available at Github.
