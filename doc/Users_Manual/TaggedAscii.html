<H1>TAGGED ASCII INPUTS TO INTEGRATED DISPLAY</H1>
<HR>

The display program reads input parameters from ascii files.
The files use tags so that the format is extensible.
Typically, tag-parameter pairs take exactly one line.
Each line contains a tag such as  'Ladar-File' followed by the parameter or
parameters as specified below.
Blank lines are allowed as well as comments which should be started with the tag '#' on each line.
<P>


<H2>PROJECT FILE TAGS</H2>

The display program reads input parameters from a single ascii Project file.

[1]  Clock		Use or not use the clock feature (and buttons)
	OnOff		"on"/"off", default is on
	
[2]  Clock-Wall-Dtic	Wall-clock time between steps when clock is running
	deltime	Delta time in s

[3]  Clock-Model-Dtic	Time in the model/scenario between steps when clock is running
	deltime	Delta time in s

[4]  Clock-Compress	Turns on time compression.  Default is off where clock increments at fixed rate.
	The feature compress time as gracefully as possible during periods where vehicles are
	moving very slowly or sitting.  Where vehicles are moving fast, time is not compressed.  As vehicles move
	more and more slowly, the time compression is gradually increased until it runs very fast for stopped vehicles.
	Following a vehicle can be done much more quickly, but one can still distinguish between fast-moving vehicles,
	ones that slow down for traffic, ones that are stopped for short periods in traffic, and ones that are parked
	for longer periods.

	vthresh     Speed threshold in mph -- time is not compressed when a vehicle is moving above this speed

<H3><A NAME="cam">Notes -- Inputs for Camera</A></H3>

Only a perspective camera is implemented.
For a perspective camera, the view is determined by the distance of the camera from the scene
and the angle that the camera covers or the zoom.
The distance is controlled by the "Dolly" thumbwheel on the viewer and is initialized by tag "Camera-Scene-Size".
The zoom angle is controlled by the "Zoom" thumbwheel on the viewer and is initialized by tag "Camera-Height-Ang".
For terrain viewing, it seems to be best to leave the zoom angle at its default of 10 deg and adjust the distance.
<P> 
<PRE>

[1]  Stereo-On-Off	Stereo status on startup 
				Because OpenInventor can't toggle raw stereo on the fly, this tag only available from defaults file CustomParms.txt.
	OnOff		"on"/"off"/"anaglyph", default is on (stereo using Nvidia shutter glasses)
	
[2]  Stereo-Offset	The angle in deg between left and right eyes.
				The perceived stereo separation stays roughly constant with scene size and zoom distance.
				It is like what you would perceive if you could scale a scene at a fixed distance from you.
				For the Coin3d library implementation, the perceived stereo separation changes with scene size and with zoom.
				It is like what you would perceive when moving up or down in an aircraft over the scene.
				I have compensated for this, by scaling the Coin value by the camera distance so it acts like the VSG version.
	Angle		Angle in deg
	
[3]  Camera-Scene-Size	With tag "Camera-Height-Ang", determines initial camera view (see above)
	Z		Camera initialized to view a scene of this size  
			This angle initializes the "Dolly" thumbwheel.
	
[4]  Camera-Height-Ang	With tag "Camera-Scene-Size", determines initial camera view (see above)
	Angle		The angle in deg that the camera sees, default = 10.
			This angle initializes the "Zoom" thumbwheel.
			Reducing this angle gives the look of a perspective camera
			Increasing the angle gives a fisheye camera look of exagurated perspective

[5] Camera-El-Max 	Maximum camera elevation angle.  The camera (user view direction) can vary from
			nadir (directly overhead) down to this angle -- by default 85 deg, close to ground level
			but not too close so as to avoid stereo problems and a ground-level view that does not
			look good with our overhead map data.
	elMax		maximum angle in deg from nadir

[6] Camera-Diag-Level	Level of diagnostics when user centers at different place on the map
	level		0=no diagnostics, 1=full diagnostics

[2] Pixmap		Turn on CH imagery overlay feature -- necessary for track registration

[3] Place-Attr-File	Input .dbf template file from which shapefile attributes are copied
			Used in outputting registered tracks -- 3 files output
			Where possible, attribute values are filled in automatically
			Otherwise, values left blank for analyst to fill in.
			The default is to use the attributes from the input track file for all output files.
			Older versions of the code input filenames, but current versions use hardwired files
			The files can be updated from the menu, which writes the new file to the same dir with the next larger version number nnn.

[9] Pixmap-Reg-Lims-D	Limits on the registration search region -- offset distances
			For the default independent registration method, values for each frame should be the same.
			For the sequential method, it is assumed that absolute errors may be larger than relative errors,
			so search distance for first frame may need to be larger than subsequent frames.

			Registration will be done for a number of tiles.  The center tile is at the input reg. loc.
			Other tiles are centered at different input reg. locs. and are contiguous.
			This is done to achieve a larger search radius than supported by an individual correlation.

	nshift		No. of tiles is (2*nshift+1) by (2*nshift+1) (default 0 for single tile at center)

[12] Pixmap-Reg-Method	Registration method

	nCalc -- Size of the region used is (nCalc by nCalc) (default = 32)

[7]  Map3d-Smooth-Last-Off	Turn off algorithm that smooths the terrain.  The result is terrain made up

	 Highlight first-hit points that are more than a threshold value above the corresponding
	 last-hit points (typically, above the ground).  This serves to highlight vertical obstructions.

	nMed		No. of Medium-Res tiles cached (default 50)
	nHi		No. of High-Res tiles cached	(default 9)
	iDiag		Diagnostic level for caching -- 0 is silent, 1 gives some diagnostics (default 0)
		
[14]  Map3d-Drape	Default visualization is the patented hybrid technique that drapes smooth surfaces but displays rough areas as discrete squares.
	 Using this tag is equivalent to pressing the 'Tile' button that causes all areas to be draped.
	 This may be better for very rough mountainous terrain with virtually no vegitation or for animations where small gaps may cause speckle.

	Writing is done on initialization centered at the initial aim point (you need to specify this point in a Project File).
	The number of tiles is determined by the hi-res size specified in the Project File
	Units are meters relative to the aim point and reference elevation (so approximately centered at origin).
	The map can be scaled, primarily for use in the Oculus Rift.

	scale		Scale map before writing
	offset	Elevation offset

[16]  Map3d-Lowres-Quality	Quality of the lowres texture (implemented for now only for the lowres texture mosaic)
		The default highest quality texture does significant smoothing of the texture.  
		This can make the map look blurrier than necessary and a 'poorer' quality rendering may improve the map look.
		It should also be faster, but I dont know if the difference is significant.
	quality	value [0.1-1.0] where 1.0 is the default highest quality with significant smoothing, and 0.1 is pixelated

[2]  Mobmap-File	Write current LAS data to LAS file
	filename	Filename (pathname)
	
[3]  Map3d-Color-Scale	Type of false color scheme for texturing DEMs and point clouds
	type	0	Natural hue scale based on absolute elevation (default)
		1	Blue-to-red hue scale based on absolute elevation 
		2	Natural hue scale based on elevation relative to the mean ground plane
		3	Blue-to-red hue scale based on elevation relative to the mean ground plane 

[4]  Mobmap-Color-Balance
	state	'on'/'off' (default is off) On histogram balances each channel independently (green channel is sometimes stronger than others)
		'off' to make no change to colors
	
[5]  Map3d--Color-Rainbow-Ranges
	hmin 	Minimum elevation corresponding to blue
	hmax	Maximum elevation corresponding to red
	
[6]  Mobmap-Bright-Min -- input brightnesses [0,255] will map into [min,1] on the screen
	min	Min brightness [0,1], default=0.3
			
[7]  Mobmap-Amp-Clip	Maps range to [0,255] 
	min	Min amp corresponding to 0 
	max	Max amp corresponding to 255
			
[8]  Mobmap-Cull-Ground	Cull all points within a threshold distance above the local ground level (determined from the low-res map elevations).	
	thresh	Threshold distance in m

[9]  Mobmap-Max-NDisplay	Max number of points to display.  
	Terrestrial lidar files are typically very large and will overwhelm most graphics cards, so the code will decimate the points until
	the number of points is less than this max value.	
	nMax	Max no. of points, default = 5000000
		
[10]  Mobmap-Clip-Extent	Clip data to the given extent rectangle
	West		West boundary in UTM coordinates
	East		East boundary in UTM coordinates
	South		South boundary in UTM coordinates
	North		North boundary in UTM coordinates

[11]  Mobmap-Dec-Ang Decimation over an angular region.
	Every 1 out of Fac samples is kept at each angle, where Fac varies linearly over the region from Fac1 to Fac2.
	Decimation is based on the scan angle recorded in the LAS record -- this is 1 byte only, so the angle
	is precision is 2 deg.  Therefore each angular bin is 2 deg wide.

	Ang1	Lower bound of angular region in deg
	Ang2	Upper bound of angular region in deg
	Fac1	Decimation factor at lower bound of angular region
	Fac2	Decimation factor at upper bound of angular region

	xOffset	Distance east 
	yOffset	Distance north 
	zOffset	Distance elevation 

[14] Mobmap-Filter-Type	Type of filtering.  Filtering basically breaks up the points into groups depending on the value filtered and you can use
     a slider to display only a subset of the groups
	type		0 for no filtering, 1 for filter on FINE algorithm quality metric TAU, 2 for filter on elevation

[15] Mobmap-Filter-Span	Span of filter bins to process.
     The default is to display all the points.  From the menu, you can limit the span to a subset.
     The advantage of this is limiting the number of points for display to eliminate or reduce decimation.
	imin	The minimum bin in the span
	imax	The maximum bin in the span

[16] Mobmap-Filter-Zlims-Abs For filtering on elevation, the span of absolute elevations to map into filter bins.
     The default is to use the min and max elevations from the file header, but these values are not always optimum.
	fmin	The min elevation to map into the filter
	fmax	The max elevation to map into the filter

[17] Mobmap-Filter-Zlims-Rel For filtering on elevation, the span of relative elevations to map into filter bins.
	fmin	The min elevation to map into the filter (default = -5.)
	fmax	The max elevation to map into the filter (default = 30.)

[18]	Mobmap-Diag-Level	Level of printed diagnostics 
	level -- 0=none, 1=minimal, 2=more, 3=all

<H3><A NAME="imap3d">Notes -- 3-D maps, Index</A></H3>

The basic idea is that one defines an index of tiles with any number of entries and also a reference point
and the code displays a region of interest (ROI) centered at that point.
It finds all tiles that intersects this ROI and constructs the proper surfaces.
