The viewer uses the basic structure and file format used by the BuckEye Program to simplify loading maps.
Data from other sources may have to be loaded in a less convenient and less flexible manner.

For BuckEye maps, the viewer expects 4 map files in the geoTiff format for each tile.
Each contains values on a regularly-spaced grid, typically at a 1-m post spacing.
So the files can be thought of as pixel images, 2 of which contain elevations of the pixels,
one of which the pixel intensity and the last a combination of pixel intensity and false color to encode elevation.
<P>

<DL>
	<DT>The first file is the lowest elevation hit for each pixel
	<DD>This is the primary DEM file for each tile and the one from which other file names are derived.
	<P>
	<DT>The second file is the highest elevation hit for each pixel
	<DD>This is the secondary DEM elevation file.  Where the elevation is significantly different, the higher elevation information is added to the map.
	Where it is within 1m, the information is not used.
	This file can be omitted but provides very useful information to the map.
	<P>
	<DT>The third file is the intensity value for each pixel
	<DD>This is an 8-bit grayscale value usually from the ladar.
	The map can be textured either with this file or the color value from the fourth file type, so at least one must be present.
	<P>
	<DT>The fourth file is color value for each pixel
	<DD>This is a 24-bit color value.
	For the BuckEye data, the intensity value is determined by the lidar and the hue is a false color based on the elevation.
	Alternatively, the color may be from satellite or other ortho-rectified imagery.
	The map can be textured either with this file or the intensity value from the third file type, so at least one must be present.
	<P>

<H3><A NAME="import_maps_formats">Map File Constraints</A></H3>

<DL>
	<DT>All maps for a particular tile should have the same number of pixel rows and columns.
	<DD>The viewer reads from the primary map file (the lowest elevation) the number of rows and columns and uses these parameters for the secondary elevation file for that tile.
	If this constraint is not met, there may be read or display errors.
	<P>
	<DT>All elevation maps for a particular tile must be coregistered.
	<DD>The viewer reads from the primary map file (the lowest elevation) the tile location and uses these parameters
	for most map functions for that tile.
	Therefore, the maps should precisely overlay or there may be registration errors in the different layers of the map
	<P>
</DL>
<H2><A NAME="import_maps_names">BUCKEYE LIDAR DIRECTORY STRUCTURE AND FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS</A></H2>

The viewer will find all relevent BuckEye files in the specified directory.
However, it will be easiest to use the data if the BuckEye directory structure is maintained.
BuckEye typically uses a separate subdirectory for each tile such as the following:
<PRE>

LasVegas							Main directory
	Vegas_Tile1						Subdirectory for tile 1
		dem_1m_a2_vegas_tile1.tif
		dem_1m_a1_vegas_tile1.tif
		int_1m_a1_vegas_tile1.tif
		mrg_1m_a1_vegas_tile1.tif
	Vegas_Tile2						Subdirectory for tile 2
		dem_1m_a2_vegas_tile2.tif
		dem_1m_a1_vegas_tile2.tif
		int_1m_a1_vegas_tile2.tif
		mrg_1m_a1_vegas_tile2.tif


</PRE>

<DL>For each tile the 4 types of map files have the following BuckEye naming conventions:
	<DT>The first file is the lowest elevation hit for each pixel
	<DD>This is the primary elevation file for each tile with a name like "dem_1m_a2_vegas_tile1.tif".
	Names of the other 3 types of file are derived from this one.
	<P>
	<DT>The second file is the highest elevation hit for each pixel
	<DD>This is the secondary elevation file and has a name like "dem_1m_a1_vegas_tile1.tif"
	Its name is derived from the first file by substituting "_a1_" for "_a2_"
	<P>
	<DT>The third file is the intensity value for each pixel
	<DD>This is an 8-bit grayscale value usually from the ladar and has a name like "int_1m_a1_vegas_tile1.tif".
	Its name is derived from the first file by substituting "_a1_" for "_a2_" and "int_" for "dem_".
	<P>
	<DT>The fourth file is color value for each pixel
	<DD>This is a 24-bit color value and has a name like mrg_1m_a1_vegas_tile1.tif.
	Its name is derived from the first file by substituting "_a1_" for "_a2_" and "mrg_" for "dem_".
	<P>
</DL>
                        
<H2><A NAME="import_maps_mrsid">BUCKEYE MRSID ORTHOPHOTO DATA</A></H2>

The elevation maps look best when textured with very high resolution orthophotos.
The resolution of these photos is typically 10 times the resolution of the elevation data and complements the DEM data very well.
The viewer uses all the MrSID imagery (any files with a .sid suffix) that it can find in the specified directory.
It assumes that the relevent orthophotos are in the specified directory and that any files with the .sid suffix are potential texture files.
It will texture with these MrSID files wherever it can and fall back on the lidar intensity in areas that the MrSID data does not cover.
