<H1>ALIRT LIDAR DATA AND NAMING CONVENTIONS</H1>
<HR>

The elevation data products for this project are provided in tiles of 3 minutes by 3 minutes.  The file and folder naming convention references the southwest geographic corner of each tile in the format DDMMSShDDDMMSSe_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS_ALIRT_RRR_SSS_LL_W_CXX.ext.

<H1>NAMING CONVENTIONS</H1>

Alirt naming conventions are as follows:
<P>



<PRE>


*DDMMSShDDDMMSSe – the southwest geographic corner of each tile, where D stands for degrees, M for minutes, S for seconds and h/e denotes the hemisphere as either N,S or E,W 
*YYYYMMDDHHMMSS – this portion of the naming convention denotes the year, date and time of the mission collect.  Y stands for year, M for month, D for day, H for hour, M for minutes, and S for seconds
*ALIRT is the name of the specific LIDAR sensor.
*RRR -  gives the resolution of the product, either 030 for 30cm point target products or 100 for 1m wide area mapping products. 
*SSS – data type code, for example, DSM for digital surface model or DTM for digital terrain model.
*LL – look number.  For wide area mapping products, this will be 00
*W – version number
*CXX – classification and release code, u for unclassified, “fo” for for official use only
.ext – the file format, this will be .tif for DSM and DTMs, which are in GeoTIFF format

Other characteristics are as follows:
* Classification- UNCLASSIFIED//For Official Use Only
* Tile Size- 3 min. x 3 min.
* Post Spacing- 1 meter
* Units- Meters
* Format- GeoTIFF 32-bit float point
* Surface type- reflective surface and bare earth (DSM/DTM respectively, LIDAR sensor derived)
* Projection- UTM
* Datum- (Horizontal) WGS-84, (Vertical) EGM-96
* Null Values- -10000
