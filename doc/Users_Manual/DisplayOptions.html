As described in the introduction, the traditional technique drapes a continuous surface over the regularly spaced elevation values.
This technique works well when displaying large areas or in cities with large buildings, but falls apart at small scales or for natural objects like trees.
The Fusion3D Viewer technique visualizes the terrain as a set of disjoint square patches.
It is combined with an algorithm that identifies smooth areas within the scene.
Where the terrain is smooth, such as in grassy areas, roads, parking lots and rooftops, it warps the patches to create a smooth surface.
For trees or shrubs or other areas where objects are under-sampled, however, the patches are left disjoint.
This has the disadvantage of leaving gaps in the data, but the human mind is very adept at filling in this missing information.
It has the strong advantage of making natural terrain look realistic – trees and bushes look stylized but still look natural and are easy to interpret.
Also, it does not add artifacts to the map, like filling in blank vertical walls where there are alcoves and other structure
and extending bridges and overpasses down to the ground. 
An additional advantage is that it can display multiple hit surfaces an one time.
A <A HREF="./Paper_EI6490A-68.doc">symposium paper</A> describes this visualization technique in more detail.
<P>
There are a number of options for the display, and these are described below
<P>

<H2><A NAME="display-draped">DRAPED SURFACE OPTION</A></H2>

As described above, the default display uses a combination of smooth surfaces and discrete squares for rough areas like trees.
The approach used by all the other viewers, however, is to drape a single surface over elevation points.
This alternative visualization option is available in the 3-D Fusion Viewer.
The user can toggle between the two techniques using the button on the left edge labeled "Drape".
<P>
The default visualization can show both the first-hit and last-hit surfaces simultaneously.
The last-hit surface is always on and the first-hit surface can be toggled on and off (see below).
The draped-surface technique, however, can show only one surface at a time.
If the first-hit surface is turned on when the draped surface is toggled on, then
the first-hit draped surface will be displayed.
If the first-hit surface is turned off when the draped surface is toggled on, then
the last-hit draped surface will be displayed.
<P>



<H2><A NAME="display-last">LAST HIT ONLY OPTION</A></H2>

By default, both the first-hit and last-hit surfaces are displayed.
The first-hit surface is only displayed at points where it differs from the last-hit surface by more than 1m.
At these points, first-hit elevations are displayed as discrete squares.
Since there are a relatively small number of points, like trees, where the first-hit surface is displayed,
one can look through this surface to the last-hit surface below.
<P>
There are occasions, however, when the user will want to turn off the first-hit surface.
For instance, where there is heavy tree cover, turning off the first-hit surface can greatly reduce the number 
of hits on trees and allow the user to concentrate on the terrain below.
The first-hit surface can be toggled on and off using the button on the left margin labeled "A1".
<P>



<H2><A NAME="display-hilite">HIGHLIGHT VERTICAL OBSTRUCTIONS OPTION</A></H2>

The default visualization uses the same color overlay to texture all points.
However there are situations where the user may want to highlight vertical obstructions --
any points that are significantly above the surrounding areas.
This option is toggled on and off using the button on the left margin labeled "Hilite".
Using the default thresholds, points are highlighted in the following manner:
<PRE>

	   < 10m above surroundings	default colors
	10 - 20m above surroundings	yellow highlight
	   > 20m above surroundings	red highlight


</PRE>
The thresholds can be adjusted from the 'Measure' menu or from a tag in the Project File.
More precisely, the algorithm measures the difference in elevation between the first-hit and last-hit surfaces at each pixel
and highlights the pixels as described above.
<P>


<H2><A NAME="display-hires">HIGH-RESOLUTION TEXTURE OPTION</A></H2>

For many BuckEye lidar maps (as well as some HALOE and ALIRT maps), high-resolution orthophoto images in MrSID format are also available.
These orthophotos are typically 10-cm resolution, whereas the elevation data is typically 1-m resolution.
Until this feature was implemented recently, the only option was to downsample the orthophoto to the elevation data resolution
to use a texture for the elevation maps.
Amost all other viewers we know of also have this restriction and the Fusion3D Viewer is one of the first to allow texturing the elevations
with full-resolution orthophotos.
<P>
The high-resolution texture can be toggled on and off using the button labeled "Hres".
Using medium-resolution texture (the same resolution as the elevation data) is faster,
so when zoomed out or searching for a landmark it may be preferable to toggle the high-res texture off.
<P>
