A sample scene is provided for basic testing of the Fusion3D viewer.
The scene is a rural area in New York that contains a road with a few houses, fields and an area with tree cover.
It was obtained from the LiDARUSA website, lidarusa.com, that contains a number of freely downloadable lidar datasets.
This point-cloud dataset, according to their website, was "Captured with snoopy A-Series mounted on a Drone.
The data is tiled so it isn't huge.  Colorized with world imagery and classified.  We are only
using a small percentage of the available lasers for this view."
<P>
The Fusion3D viewer is capable of ingesting very large maps but we used only the A1 tile of the 4 available,
and further cropped the point cloud to minimize the Fusion3D distribution download.
We derived DSMs from the downloaded A1 point cloud using an Army Research Lab (ARL) developed gridding utility.
This utility produces two DSMs:  a last-hit (a2) DSM and a first-hit (a1) DSM
Note that the Fusion3D viewer can display both DSM's simultaneously -- a feature that we think is unique among terrain viewers
-- and that the a1-DSM can be toggled on or off with a viewer button.
<P>
The point cloud was cropped to the upper-left corner of the image to minimize size.
It was also culled with another ARL utility to eliminate point-cloud points very near the last-hit DSM.
This is not necessary for the viewer but was done to illustrate how the DSM and point cloud can be used together.
It has 2 advantages:  It reduces the cloud size (and total dataset size) by about half and it also reduces visual clutter.
<P>
The DSMs for the sample scene as rendered in the Fusion3D viewer are shown below.
