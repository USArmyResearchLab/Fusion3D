The Fusion3D viewer was written to provide the simplest, most natural and useful visualization of 3D terrain maps based on Digital Surface Models (DSMs).
It can fuse the DSM maps with orthophotos, point clouds and annotation overlays to increase their utility.
It has many features that facilitate visualization including the following:
<dl>
<dt>Built-in capability for 3D stereo display.
<dd>3D terrain data is a natural for 3D display, making the maps much easier to interpret.
Athough stereo is not in fashion at this moment, if you have access to the proper hardware, stereo dramatically improves the viewing experience.
The viewer automatically manages the stereo parameters, always keeping the stereo separation at comfortable levels and convergence at the depth of the screen
no matter how you zoom, pan or move around the scane.
<P>

<dt>A unique visualization approach.
<dd>gives a much more natural visualization of the terrain, avoiding the 'melted chocolate' look typical of other viewers.
This patented technique, described in more detail in the accompanying documentation, combines the best aspects DSMs and point clouds.
It provides a much more natural depiction of trees, bushes and small man-made objects like power lines, poles, fences and the like.
<P>
<dt>Fusion of DSMs with full-resolution orthophotos.
<dd>Orthophotos can have as much as 10 times the resolution of the associated DSMs.
Using them at full resolution provides crucial detail that complements the elevation information in the DSMs.
Many viewers force you to downsample the orthophoto to the resolution of the DSM.
<P>
<dt>Fusion of DSMs with point clouds.
<dd>The visualization technique used by Fusion3D allows both DSMs and point clouds to be displayed together without any preprocessing.
The DSM draping in other viewers that covers important point cloud features is avoided in this viewer.
<P>
<dt>Very large maps
<dd>The viewer handles province sized maps, allowing the user to zoom in and out and move freely without reloading map tiles.
Maps as large as 100km by 70km have been tested.

The picture above shows part of a elevation map of Ottawa featuring a bridge and both rough areas with trees and smooth areas with grass and roads.
The data is a DSM (DSM only, no point clouds) captured with a lidar sensor.
The picture shows the anaglyph stereo 3D available with the Fusion3D viewer.
Of course the quadbuffered stereo, also supported, shows the scene in much higher quality.
<P>
The rendering of the bridge shows the advantages of the Fusion3D visualization technique where the standard approach of draping the DSM
obscures all the important bridge detail (see image below).
Trees look rough and approximate what you would see with a point cloud.
The smooth areas, however, remain smooth and unbroken even when you zoom in closely.
Contrast this with the image below as would be rendered with other viewers.
<P>
Also, note that there is a sign and a light pole on the right side of the road at the lower left of the picture.
The top edge of these were sampled by the lidar and they show up correctly in the Fusion3D rendering (just visible in this image).
In the draped image below, the poles look virtually identical to the trees and could easily be missed.

The second picture shows the same bridge in Ottawa as it would be rendered with any other viewer that we know of.
These viewers drape the DSM with a single surface, causing the unnatural 'melted chocolate' look and obscuring detail.

<H2><A NAME="fusion3d_org">ORGANIZATION</A></H2>

The Fusion3D terrain viewer was developed internally at the US Army Research Laboratory.
As of November 2020, it is being transitioned to open source in the hope that it will be useful to a larger community.
The primary developer is Jeff Dammann and we would welcome comments or questions to him at tj71dammann@poetworld.net.
We are hoping for interest in the viewer and, should that develop, we will develop a FAQ, a site for comments/questions, and other community structures.
<P>
There is a user's manual that can be accessed either through the 'Help' menu in the Fusion3D viewer
or by setting your browser to the file 'doc/index.html'.
In the user's manual there are PowerPoint tutorials on 'Getting Started' as well as other basic features.
<P>
There is a sample map provided in the distribution that includes both DSMs and point clouds.
This map is described in file 'README_SAMPLE_DATA.html'.
<P>
There is also a Reference Manual currently under development.
If there is interest, this manual will be added to the distribution.
<P>
Below are instructions for building the Fusion3D viewer.
Note that it does not require formal installation 
A Visual Studio 2017 solution is provided as well as CMake files that have been tested on Windows and Linux (Ubuntu) system.

<H4><A NAME="fusion3d_libs_coin">COIN3D</A></H4>

Coin3d is the basic graphics library used by Fusion3D.
It is an independently-derived implementation of the OpenInventor API which is a high-level code based on OpenGL.
<P>
There are Coin3d binaries available for Windows (both 32- and 64-bit).
For other OSs, there are CMake files for building.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="fusion3d_libs_soqt">SOQT</A></H4>

The core of OpenInventor is OS independent as is the Coin3d library implementation.
Low-level OS-dependent functions are implemented in several bridge libraries.
SoQt is a bridge to Qt which in turn interfaces with a number of OSs.
(Quarter is a newer bridge library to Qt but is lighter weight and does not have some of the key viewer functionality that Fusion3D depends on.)
<P>
There are SoQt binaries available for Windows (both 32- and 64-bit).
For other OSs, there are CMake files for building.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="fusion3d_libs_qt">QT</A></H4>

There are Qt binaries available for Windows (both 32- and 64-bit) and other common OS configurations.
Also, there CMake files for building.
<P>

<H4><A NAME="fusion3d_libs_gdal">GDAL</A></H4>

There are GDAL binaries available for Windows (both 32- and 64-bit), Mac and a variety of Linux variants.
As far as I can find, only Release binaries are available.

<H4><A NAME="fusion3d_libs_mrsid">MRSID</A></H4>

There are MrSID binaries available for Windows and Visual Studio 2019/2017/2015/2013 (both 32- and 64-bit).
For Linux (GCC), Mac (Clang), IOS (Clang) and Android (GCC).
<P>

<H4><A NAME="fusion3d_libs_assimp">ASSIMP</A></H4>

There are virtually no Assimp binaries available for any OS
However, there are well-maintained CMake files for building.

The premade solution is set up to build both Release and Debug in x64.
It is included in subdirectory build/msvc2017.
The Visual Studio solution can be extended to x86 but this will require extra editing.
<P>
Building with Visual Studio and Qt requires that the Visual Studio Qt Addin be installed.
This addin is available free as a .vsix file that will automatically install when opened.

<H2><A NAME="fusion3d_windows_cmake">BUILDING FOR WINDOWS AND VISUAL STUDIO -- USING CMAKE</A></H2>

The basic approach to CMake taken here is to keep the CMake file simple and direct.
With apologies to CMake experts, this will require more editing of the CMake files but should be simpler
for non-experts and hopefully more robust.
The user will have to edit some paths to external libraries and perhaps some basic build configurations before running CMake.
<P>
First, the external libraries are built separately rather than being built within the Fusion3D CMake structure.
In many cases, the easiest way to get the libraries is to get the binaries.
Also, the Coin and SoQt libraries are not heavily maintained and may have issues building with CMake.
It should be easier to deal with potential problems building them separately.
Paths to the external libraries are defined near the top of the root CMake file and must be edited
to point the the installed location of the libraries.
<P>
Second, Visual Studio by convention builds multiple configurations in the same solution.
Typically, these are 'x86' (the 32-bit version) 'Release' and 'Debug' and 'x64' (the 64-bit version) 'Release' and 'Debug'.
The default in the root CMakeLists.txt is to build both Release and Debug for x64.
At the top of that file you can choose instead to build a single configuration or to build x86.
<P>
The Visual Studio solution will have the correct parameters for the chosen configurations, but parameters
for other configurations will be wrong.
One can either generate separate Visual Studio Solutions for each configuration or modify the single
Visual Studio solution for other configurations.
Most of the necessary parameters, particularly ones internal to Visual Studio, are modified appropriatly.
Others, like external library '.lib' files will be copied without changes and will need to be edited.
<P>




<PRE>

	Building with Visual Studio and Qt requires that the Visual Studio Qt Addin be installed.
		This addin is available free as a .vsix file that will automatically install when opened.

	CMake for Windows/VisualStudio requires the UCRT SDK (Universal C Runtime Library)
		If it does not find this, then it will not find the C++ compiler and abort
		This should be standard in Windows10 but is an optional component of Visual Studio and may need an additional install


</PRE>

<H3><A NAME="fusion3d_windows_cmake_gui">Using the CMake GUI</A></H3>
<PRE>

Editing the CMake file
	As described in more detail above, the root CMake file must be edited to establish the basic
	configuration and pathnames to libraries will also have to be modified.

Basic GUI parameters:
	Where is the source code:  The Fusion3D root directory (with root CmakeLists.txt file)
	Where to build the binaries:  Conventionally this is done in a Fusion3d subdirectory like 'build'

	After pressing Configure button, on the resulting submenu:
		Specify the generator for this project: From the pulldown, enter the IDE or compiler of choice
		Optional platform for generator (if empty, uses Win32):
			For x64, select 'x64' from the pulldown menu

	Generate: This should create a Visual Studio solution 

Comments:
	Choosing the x64 platform from the submenu will cause Visual Studio to default to 64-bit configuration
	(both Release and Debug).  As described above, the x86 Release/Debug can also be generated from
	the single Visual Studio solution.  Parameters for the chosen configuration will be correct, but
	other configurations will not.  Some of the parameters will be correctly modified but others
	will have to be edited by hand.

1.  It is important that Qt be installed using the standard Ubuntu install procedure ('sudo apt-get install qt5-default') rather than downloaded
from the Qt website using their online installer.  Otherwise there can be errors Qt platform plugin cant be found/loaded.

<H3><A NAME="fusion3d_libs">Linking External Library .so Files</A></H3>

You will need to link the Fusion3D executable to external library .so files for any external libraries that have not been installed and are already in standard locations.
One can copy or link the .so files into the /usr/lib (or other standard location of choice) or one can do the following:
<P>

<PRE>

	In /etc/ld.conf.so
		Create file 'randomLibs.conf'
			Enter complete pathnames to all required .so files (eg. /home/arl/coin-4.0.0-x64/lib)

	Update the the system by running
		sudo ldconfig



</PRE>
<H3><A NAME="fusion3d_libs">Required Changes to Main CMake File CMakeLists.txt </A></H3>

The main CMake file Fusion3D/CMakeLists.txt is configured for Windows/Visual Studio and external libraries that are stored locally rather than installed.
This file must be edited to work on Linux, but the edits should not be difficult.
Roughly, they are as follows:
<P>

<PRE>

	1.  As provided, both Debug and Release versions are made simultaneously to be combined into a single Visual Studio solution.
	Command line CMake and many linux IDEs like Code::Blocks allow only one Debug/Release version at a time.
	Uncomment the line to make the desired option:
		# set(CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE Release)		# Debug / Release

	2.  Set the desired install directory by modifying the following line:
		set(CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX "C:/Fusion3D")	# 

	3.  Some external libraries like GDAL and KML will probably be installed so CMake will find them in standard directories
	In this case, you can modify the lines that cause CMake to look for them in specified directories:
		option(ADD_DIRS_GDAL  "Libs and includes not in default dirs -- GDAL"  OFF)	
		option(ADD_DIRS_KML   "Libs and includes not in default dirs -- KML"   OFF)

	4.  Other external libraries like Coin and SoQt may not be installed
	In this case do not modify lines like
		option(ADD_DIRS_COIN  "Libs and includes not in default dirs -- Coin"  ON)

	The path to the library will have to be modified and one would need to edit the line:
			set(PATH_COIN   "C:/coin-4.0.0-msvc15-x64/Coin3D")
	
	


</PRE>







<H2><A NAME="fusion3d_other">OTHER ISSUES</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="fusion3d_libs">MrSID Linux Version Problems with Newer Compilers</A></H3>

The latest (Oct 2020) download of the MrSID SDK for linux generates compile errors for gcc compiler versions greater than version 5.
It was verified with gcc version 5, checks the gcc version number and will not compile for newer gcc versions.
The best fix for this problem is to edit a .h file in the MrSID distribution:
<PRE>

	In file:  <install dir>\MrSID_DSDK-9.5.4.4709-win64-vc15\Raster_DSDK\include\lt_platform.h
	Change line:	#if (defined(__GNUC__) || defined(__GNUG__)) && (3 <= __GNUC__ && __GNUC__ <= 5)
	To    line:	#if (defined(__GNUC__) || defined(__GNUG__)) && (3 <= __GNUC__ && __GNUC__ <= 9) // Any number >= to current compiler version


</PRE>
If this is not possible, then you can redefine the the __GNUC__ value in the internals.h file like the following
<PRE>

	#define __GNUC__ 5


</PRE>
This will generate warnings but it appears it has no ill effect.
<P>




<H3><A NAME="fusion3d_libs">GDAL Environment Variables</A></H3>

The GDAL library requires an environment variable GDAL_DATA that points to text files that are used to help implement
the large variety of potential coordinate systems.
As of GDAL 3.0, a second environment variable is also required: PROJ_LIB which must point to the directory that has the file proj.db.
As of this rev, GDAL uses the Proj library to help determine coordinate systems.
<P>
If GDAL is installed then this environment variable may be set, but if it is not then try the following options:


<PRE>

	GDAL_DATA should point to a subdirectory supplied with the GDAL distribution where various .csv files and other text files
		describe various coordinate systems (directory 'gdal_data' in some Windows distributions, 'share/gdal' in some linux distributions).
	PROJ_LIB should be the path to the file proj.db (not including the filename itself).

	1.  If possible, add the definitions to the system or user environment variables.
		For linux, add the paths to the file '/etc/environment' something like
			GDAL_DATA="/usr/share/gdal"
			PROJ_LIB="/usr/share/proj"
		Restart or otherwise ensure that the new environment variables are incorporated


	2a.  If GDAL_DATA is unset at runtime, Fusion3D will set it to a subdirectory within the install directory
			GDAL_DATA=<install-dir>/Fusion3D/bin/GDAL/gdal-data
			This works on Windows for the Release version of the code but not the Debug version

	2b.  If PROJ_LIB is unset at runtime, Fusion3D will set it to a subdirectory within the install directory
			PROJ_LIB=<install-dir>/Fusion3D/bin/GDAL/proj6/share
			This works on Windows for the Release version of the code but not the Debug version

	3.  For Windows and Visual Studio, you can set an environment variable within Visual Studio
			Project Properties -> Configuration Properties -> Debugging -> Environment
				set environment variable (eg GDAL_DATA=C:\Fusion3D\bin\GDAL\gdal-data)


</PRE>
